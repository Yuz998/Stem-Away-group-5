The method has been applied to the solitary histidine residue of lysozyme, alpha-lytic protease, and Streptomyces griseus (S.G.) trypsin, as well as to the amino terminus of the latter protein.	The following parameters were obtained for reaction with N2ph-F at 20 degrees C in 0.1 N KCl: the histidine of hen egg-white lysozyme, pKa of 6.4 and second-order velocity constant of 0.188 M-1 min-1; the histidine of alpha-lytic protease, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0235 M-1 min-1; the histidine of S.G. trypsin, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0328 M-1 min-1; the valyl amino terminus of S.G. trypsin, pKa of 8.1 and second-order velocity constant of 0.403 M-1 min-1.	Histones, protamine and bovine serum albumin are poor phosphoryl acceptors.	Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) induction by glucagon and dexamethasone in the liver of tumor-bearing chickens was studied and compared with induction in healthy animals.	Similar failure of TAT induction was not detectable when glucagon was used instead of dexamethasone.	Thus, the cells in defined medium contain cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors and have tyrosine aminotransferase which can be induced by glucocorticoids, serum or insulin.	The observed solubility-enhancing effects of albumin could be explained solely on its calcium-binding ability and thereby, altered ionized calcium level.	The interactions between pancreatic lipase and colipase and the substrate and the effect of bile salts on these interactions have been investigated by the use of kinetic experiments and studies on the semiquantitative phase distribution of lipase and colipase activities.	In the presence of bile salt, colipase promotes the binding of lipase to the "supersubstrate" but not to other hydrophobic interfaces, and catalytic activity is reestablished.	Kinetic data indicate that the binding between colipase and lipase in the presence of substrate is strong and occurs in an approximately stoichiometric relationship.	(3) In the outer segments of vertebrate receptors, absorption of light by rhodopsin causes the plasma membrane to hyperpolarize due to a decrease in sodium conductance, possibly mediated by calcium ions.	Cock acrosin and endopeptidases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, collagenase and elastase hydrolyzed the membrane whereas exopeptidases such as leucine aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase A did not.	Phospholipase A, sulfatase, hyaluronidase, beta-glucuronidase and rabbit testicular acrosin also failed to hydrolyze the membrane.	Cock acrosin hydrolysis of the ovum surface was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor.	The studies suggest that: the increase in vascular permeability that occurs as a consequence of burn injuries is humorally mediated; albumin leakage is limited to the injured tissues; and histamine, serotonin, and presumably catecholamines play significant roles in the development of this phenomenon.	By comparsion of plasmin and trypsin in various assays it could further be improved that the gastric juice in these cases contained plasminogen activator and plasmin.	The extracellular space (ECS) of muscle from each ventricle of the heart (RV and LV), the atria, diaphragm, and quadriceps was estimated in the anesthetized rabbit from the distribution volumes of [14C]insulin, [14C]sucrose, [51Cr]EDTA, and C1--.	Tyramine (10(-3)M) in the presence of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (pheniprazine, 10(-5)M) and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (theophylline, 10(-3)M) significantly (P less than 0.01) stimulated renin release when values were compared to control observations for media containing only the inhibitors.	Tyramine-induced stimulation of renin release was blocked by the beta-blocking agent, propranolol (2 X 10(-4) M), and the neural uptake blocking agent, cocaine (10(-5) M), but not by the alpha-antagonist, phentolamine (9 X 10(-4) M).	A monolayer reaction system employing tripropionin and siliconized glass beads was used to study the effects of taurodeoxycholate and colipase on the catalytic activity, interfacial stability, and interfacial affinity of porcine pancreatic lipase B (EC 3.1.1.3) The stability and catalytic activity of lipase at the bead-water interface are governed by the same two ionizable groups with pKa values (in the absence of cofactors) of 5.6 and 9.3.	More importantly, colipase enables the adsorption of lipase in the presence of bile salt, thereby reversing the inhibition.	The hydrolysis of all the proteins except fibrinogen and elastin was increased by addition of urea.	In contrast to l-leucine, l-norleucine or l-valine did not enhance insulin release or fluorescence of NAD(P)H. KIV, alpha-keto-beta-methylvaleric acid (KMV), KIC and KC raised the production their corresponding amino acids by islet cells.	Rapid infusion of large volumes of fluids and electrolytes, together with continuous infusion of low doses of insulin, provides effective restoration of fluid and electrolyte balance and correction of metabolic derangements.	In order to investigate the possible relationship between a glucose-containing pump prime and changes in plasma potassium during extracorporeal circulation, determinations were made of blood glucose and plasma insulin, potassium, and magnesium in 18 subjects undergoing open-heart surgery.	It was found that the elimination of glucose was considerably impaired during extracorporeal circulation, in spite of high insulin levels.	During the first minutes of extracorporeal circulation, plasma potassium fell more than during the glucose tolerance test, in spite of comparable insulin levels.	It is concluded that changes in plasma potassium during extracorporeal circulation do not reflect insulin activity to any noticeable extent.	Single administration of hydrocortisone or insulin into rats (body weight 200 g) and also combined treatment of the animals with the hormones at large doses caused a distinct increase in activities of anode and cathode isoenzymes of tyrosine-alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase in soluble fraction; total activity of the enzyme was also increased in mitochondria of rat liver tissue.	per kilogram of a solution containing either (A) glucose in water, (B) salt-poor albumin, (C) NaHCO3, or (D) a combination of albumin and NaHCO3.	Plasma renin activity increased significantly during halothane anaesthesia alone whereas the surgical manipulations did not further influence mean values significantly.	Consideration is given to progestational agents, oxytocics, beta-mimetics, corticosteroids, insulin, hypotensive agents, diuretics and psychiatric drugs.	the combination of the beta-mimetics and corticosteroids with the aim of preventing impending premature onset of labour and to ensure foetal pulmonary maturation; the combination of insulin and corticosteroids given to diabetics with the aim of preventing hyaline membrane disease; the combination of corticosteroids with anti-histamines in the treatment of rhesus disease; the association of oxytocics with large quantities of intravenous fluid in the case of post-partum haemorrhage and hypontensive medication combinations and the problems which may result with emergency anaesthesis.	Inhibition of cardiac beta-receptors by propranolol suppressed the positive inotropic effect of insulin.	These findings support the hypothesis that insulin releases catecholamines from the myocardium.	In the esterasic dosage of plasminogen, the authors aim to determine the optimal ratio between the amount of streptokinase to add and of plasminogen itself.	Therefore, the endogenous insulin antibody complex must be splitted at a pH lower than 5 and the total IRI (TIRI) is separated by ethanol extraction.	Enzymes obtained from these two sources were characterized and found to behave differently from the mitochondrial glutaminase of both normal and tumour-bearing mice.	Employing this method, we have simultaneously quantified acid, pepsin, and total secretory outputs; rates of gastric emptying of meal and secretions; and serum gastrin levels during digestion.	However, in microheterogeneous forms of acrosin, alanine and methionine were also detected in end group analysis.	In the bromazepan series (c), acid output and psychomotor performance decreased and, after the first hour, increased almost parallely, while glucose and gastrin levels remained unchanged.	In series (d), an additive effect of insulin and bromazepam occurred: acid output and psychomotor performance were lower than after insulin alone; peak acid secretion, maximal hypoglycemia and peak of serum-gastrin were shifted to the right.	It is concluded that the lowered basal as well as insulin-stimulated acid secretion after bromazepam is due to the central effect of the drug, and that this effect is mediated to the gastric glands directly via autonomic nervous pathways without involving a release of endogenous gastrin.	A label for the bilirubin binding sites of human serum albumin was synthesized by reacting 2 mol of Woodward's reagent K (N-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium-3'-sulfonate) with 1 mol of bilirubin.	Covalent labeling was achieved by reacting the label with human serum albumin under nitrogen at pH 9.4 and 20 degrees.	The absorption, fluorescence and CD spectra of the label in a complex with human serum albumin were similar to those of the bilirubin human serum albumin complex.	Under conditions in which superoxide dismutase inhibition was incomplete, catalase inhibited the reaction but mannitol had no effect.	This conclusion was based on observations that the growth-promoting activity could not be removed from albumin, and that the specific activity of albumin remained unaltered after the following procedures: molecular sieving at pH 7.5 at pH 3.0, and in 8 M urea at pH 6.6; ion exchange chromatography at pH 4.3 and in 8 M urea at pH 7.2; isoelectric focusing; charcoal treatment; acetone precipitation; and reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol in the presence of 8 M urea.	We have studied the effect of chlorpromazine and PGF2alpha on the blood and amniotic fluid levels of prolactin over a 1-hour period of time in women who were in the 14th-20th week of gestation.	Following intramuscular injection of chlorpromazine, maternal plasma prolactin rose 1.0- to 2.5-fold.	A 0.3 mug intraventricular dose of isoproterenol, which is one-thirtieth of the intraperitoneal dose required to stimulate renin release, induced the release of renin into the systemic circulation.	Hypertonic saline and carbachol suppressed renin release.	(3) The adenyl cyclase system participates in the regulation of proinsulin synthesis since exogenous cyclic AMP, glucagon, and caffeine are stimulatory.	A similar pattern of prolactin was observed in a cross-sectional study in which different groups of intact animals were bled following a 3-min period of ether exposure, at ages ranging from 20 to 70 daysmthe results indicate that unlike FSH secretion, prolactin secretion is not controlled by the seminiferous tubules.	Augmentation of myocardial ischemic damage occurred as a consequence of increasing myocardial oxygen requirements (isoproterenol, glucagon, ouabain, bretylium tosylate, tachycardia); by decreasing myocardial oxygen supply either directly (hypoxia, anemia) or through reduction of collateral flow (hemorrhagic hypotension, minoxidil) or by decreasing substrate availability glycemia).	L-cysteine, and with papain (EC 3.4.22.2) and bovine serum albumin are discussed.	The second-order rate constants (k2) for the reactions of compound (I) and of Nbd chloride with GSH, papain, albumin, ficin, 2-benzimidazolylmethanethiol and 2-benzimidazolylethanethiol were determined at 25.0 degrees C and various pH values.	At pH4 the values of k2(compound I)/k2(Nbd chloride) are: GSH, 288; albumin, 36; papain 3 X 10(3); ficin, 3 X 10(4).	The catalytic activity of phosvitin in Fe(II) oxidation and the addition of iron to transferrin were studied under various conditions.	A scheme for the mobilization and transfer of iron in the chicken, including the role of ferroxidase, phosyitin and transferrin, is presented.	At pH values below 6.7, diferric transferrin readily loses iron.	A temporary reduction of pH provides a simple method for selectively attaching iron to one metal-binding site, and allows double isotopic labelling of the transferrin molecule.	Hearts were perfused with 5 mM glucose and 10(-2) U/ml of insulin in order to enhance metabolsim of glucose relative to that of fatty acids.	In contrast to other plants, which have been reported to contain multiple forms of catalase, only one form of this enzyme was revealed when crude extracts were subjected to starch gel electrophoresis or to polyacrylamide disc-gel electrophoresis.	Autoactivation of proacrosin to acrosin takes place optimally at slightly alkaline pH and in the presence of calcium ions.	Activation is considerably accelerated by catalytic amounts of trypsin or highly purified acrosin.	This enzyme was specific for adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate, did not utilize adenine 5'-phosphosulfate, and transferred to a carrier molecule that was identical with thioredoxin in molecular weight and amino acid composition.	young or adult, male or female animals, being either intact, gonadectomized or gonadectomized and treated with oestrone), differing  in age and/or endocrine status, will react to a single dose of perphenazine by an acute release of pituitary prolactin in proportion to their initial plasma prolactin levels.	The results obtained after perphenazine treatment in the latter group made it clear that the effect of oestrogen treatment on prolactin release can be completely blocked by increasing synthesis and/or release of the prolactin-release inhibiting factor (PIF).	Since perphenazine induces decrease of pituitary prolactin and a concomitant increase of plasma prolactin levels through lowered PIF-action, the positive effect of oestrogens on prolactin release (as observed in gonadectomized male and young female rats) apparently is caused by a different mode of action.	PAF extracted with ethanol from the albumin to which it is usually bound during preparation, exhibited similar characteristics, except that secretion of up to 90% of the serotonin was induced.	Experiments with calcium ion and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid showed that the difference spectra obtained with the tetracyclines and human serum albumin were not the result of metallic bridge-chelate formation.	Administration of hydrocortisone or insulin and also a simultaneous use of these hormones in a high dose caused a marked elevation of the total activity of tyrosine-alpha-ketoglutaric transaminase and its anode and cathode isoenzymes in the soluble fraction of the liver in the sexually immature (weighing 100-110 g) and mature (weighing 180-200 g) male rats.	A simultaneous injection of hydrocortisone and insulin to the sexaully mature male rats caused the same increase in the tyrosine-alpha-ketoglutaric transaminase activity in the hepatic mitochondria as after the administration of glucocorticosteriod alone.	It is supposed that androgens played a significant role in the realization of the inducing action of glucocorticoids and insulin influencing the synthesis of tyrosine-alpha-ketoglutaric transaminase in different directions in the mitochondria of the liver of young and sexually mature animals.	We have therefore studied the effect on blood pressure, heart rate and plasma renin activity of the beta blocking drug oxprenolol (Trasicor) which has considerable intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, both alone and in combination with the benzothiadiazine cyclopenthiazide.	Serum gastrin levels remained essentially unaffected by the acidification of the intestinal meal while exogenous secretin significantly lowered them.	Norgestrel showed greater affinity to plasma than to human serum albumin indicating specific norgestrel binding protein(s) in the plasma.	alpha1-acid glycoprotein showed high affinity for norgestrel when compared with human serum albumin.	The inhibition of this cleavage by superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) and catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), and by free radical scavengers suggests that the degradation of DNA observed to accompany the cytotoxic action of mitomycin C is largely due to the free radical O2.	In contrast to the behavior of the antibiotic streptonigrin, mitomycin C does not inactivate the protective enzymes superoxide dismutase or catalase.	Improvement, as judged by the higher tissue activities obtained, in the assay method for this enzyme was achieved through use of phosphatidic acids sonicated in buffer-detergent solution saturated with ether and containing bovine serum albumin and use of short incubation times which essentially provided a measure of initial rates.	The value for deltaA% correlates well with the percentage of alpha2-fraction as determined by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate, as well as with orosomucoid and ceruloplasmin, all of which are acute phase reactant(s).	Total and lipid phosphorus were measured in the duodenal aspirate of 24 fasting subjects following an injection of cholecystokinin.	Although the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of intact animals, it either does not alter, or it inhibits in vitro insulin secretion.	We recently demonstrated that pancreatic islets contain substantial amounts of monoamine oxidase (MAO), and that MAO inhibitors such as iproniazid and tranylcypromine can alter insulin secretion.	In the present study, we determined if other drugs that affect insulin secretion, alter the MAO activity of homogenates of rabbit pancreatic islets (collagenase technique) or liver.	In the absence of added monoamines, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine do not alter basal or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from rabbit pancreas.	One mechanism through which adrenergic antagonists and ethanol modify in vitro insulin secretion may be by inhibiting pancreatic islet MAO.	Blood cimetidine and plasma gastrin were measured in serial blood samples.	In contrast, for catalase the fixation with glutaraldehyde is the prerequistie for demonstration of its peroxidatic activity.	The maximal peroxidatic activity was obtained after treatment of catalase with 3% glutaraldehyde, higher concentrations being inhibitory.	After the fixation of tissue with 3% glutaraldehyde and incubation in the DAB-medium containing 10(-1)M H2O2 and at pH 10.5 (catalase medium), the staining in the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi-apparatus and in secretory granules was completely inhibited and reaction product was localized exclusively in small (0.2-0.5 mu) particles similar to small peroxisomes described in various other cell-types.	The activities of catalase and alcohol oxidase were confirmed in the particulate fractions throughout the cultivation period, whereas the activities of formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase were not detected in the particles.	Effects of substitution of vinyl groups of hemin with formyl groups on the optical and ligand binding properties of horse heart ferric myoglobin were investigated.	These results indicate that affinities of ferric myoglobin for ligands, in contrast to those of the ferrous form for oxygen and carbon monoxide (Sono, M., and Asakura, T. (1975) J. Biol.	The stimulation of renal medullary adenylate cyclase by saturating concentrations of glucagon was additive to the saturating doses of vasopressin.	Three PLP-dependent enzymes (serine dehydratase, ornithine-delta-aminotransferase, and tyrosine aminotransferase) and two non-PLP-dependent enzymes (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) were induced in vitamin B-6 deficient and control rats by feeding them high-protein diets or by injecting them with glucagon or dexamethasone.	The secretion of immunoreactive insulin and somatotropin after glucose was similar in patients with delirium tremens and alcoholic hallucinosis.	For excluding of a disturbance of the carbohydrate metabolism in addition to blood sugar determinations, glucose tolerance and tolbutamide tests, the determination of insulin activity is indicated.	Benzodiazepines (diazepam, oxazepam, chlordiazepoxide) inhibited competitively the binding of tryptophan onto rat serum albumin.	In essential hypertension the plasma renin level makes it possible to a certain extent to predict whether a patient will benefit from diuretics or from beta-blocking agents.	After a 1-h preincubation to remove endogenous insulin, adipose tissue of obese mice (C57BL/L4 ob/ob) had a lower rate of glucose metabolism than tissue which was not preincubated.	In five conscious dogs with gastric fistula and two duodenal cannulas, plasma RIA secretin and gastrin levels were determined in response to 1) infusion of 0.1 N HCl in the proximal duodenal cannula, 2) ingestion of a meal, and 3) intraduodenal infusion of 0.1 N HCl following ingestion of a meal.	However, no significant change occurred in the secretin levels after ingestion of a meal, whereas significant increase in plasma gastrin level was observed.	For four of these, a comparative study was made with isoproterenol, glucagon and ouabaine.	In 14 patients anaesthetized before undergoing an orthopedic surgical intervention, the variations induced by anaesthesia in the 17 hydroxycorticosterone rate, catecholamine, somatotropic hormone (STH), insulin, glycemia, free fatty acids and thyrotropin (TSH), all these variations were studied before the surgery.	The reaction of 1 equiv of reagent with zinc insulin in dimethylformamide in the presence of triethylamine yields as one of the products NalphaA1, NepsilonB29-carbonylbis(methionyl)insulin, (CBM-insulin).	Treatment of CBM-insulin with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) in 70% formic acid for 1 h resulted in nearly complete removal of the methionine bridge to yield insulin.	The binding of suramin to bovine and human serum albumin was investigated by gel filtration and spectroscopic measurements.	Besides some low-affinity binding sites suramin has, on the bovine serum albumin molecule one and on the human serum albumin molecule two, high-affinity binding sites.	Further, it is suggested that high concentrations of suramin provoke an unfolding of the albumin moleculse.	In order to explain the unusual behaviour of suramin in connection with the displacement of other ligands from the albumin binding the fluorescence probe 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) was employed as a reporter group molecule for fluorescence as well as circular dichroism measurements.	By these measurements it could be shown that suramin greatly influences the microorganization of both albumin molecules.	The mechanism by which clonidine suppresses renin release was investigated in conscious rats.	These results indicate a peripheral site of action for suppression of renin release by clonidine.	The alpha-adrenergic blocking drug phentolamine prevented clonidine suppression of renin release in sodium-depleted rats and was partially effective in normal rats.	Phentolamine blocked the decrease in renin caused by clonidine in ganglion-blocked rats.	Clozapine, a new neuroleptic agent with alpha-adrenergic blocking activity, or phenoxybenzamine blocked the effect of clonidine on renin release in both sodium-depleted and normal rats.	After ganglionic blockade in sodium-depleted rats, clonidine caused a significantly greater suppression of renin release than did an equipressor dose of methoxamine.	These data, combined with hemodynamic correlates, suggest that clonidine inhibits renin release by activation of an intrarenal alpha-adrenergic receptor.	While oral glucose load and intravenous glucose infusion did not suppress glucagon secretion, insulin administration induced a prompt depression in glucagon levels.	Glucagon, insulin, and gastrin levels were suppressed by somatostatin while calcium infusion caused a paradoxical increase.	Secretion of gastrin in response to food was unaffected by cimetidine.	High concentrations of albumin protected some of the substrate phospholipids from hydrolysis, presumably through complexation to the lipoprotein.	The soluble phospholipase A is inhibited by albumin, soluble protein (cytoplasmic), heparin, and protamine sulfate.	Superimposed intravenous infusion of secretin and cholecystokinin increased acid disposal, particularly in patients with duodenal ulcer, and increased the associated rate of secretion of water and electrolytes or changed net absorption to net secretion.	The kinetics of the photodynamic desactivation of lysozyme in presence of acridine orange as the sensitizer have been investigated in detail varying oxygen, protein, dye concentration, ionic strength and pH value.	Changing the solvent from water to D2O or by quenching experiments in presence of azide ions it could be shown that the desactivation of lysozyme is caused exclusively by singlet oxygen.	The kinetical analysis shows that additional chemical reaction between singlet oxygen and lysozyme would have only little influence on the kinetics of the desactivation as long as their products would be enzymatically active and their kinetical constants would be less than about 1 X 10(8) m(-1) sec(-1)).	Levels of glucose, insulin, and glucagon in portal vein plasma and of liver glycogen and cyclic AMP and activities of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase in liver were assayed in control (CONT) rats and rats infected (INF) with Diplococcus pneumoniae.	Thus, in rabbits and rats, timolol effectively depresses both basal and stimulated plasma renin levels.	Human diferric transferrin was partially labeled with 59Fe at low or neutral pH (chemically labeled) and by replacement of diferric iron previously donated to rabbit reticulocytes (biologically labeled).	The pH-dependent iron dissociation studies of biologically labeled transferrin solutions indicated that Fe3+, bound at the site from which the metal was initially utilized by the cells, dissociated between pH 5.8 and 7.4.	These findings suggest that each human transferrin iron-binding site has different acid-base iron-binding properties which could be related to the observed heterogenic rabbit reticulocyte iron-donating properties of human transferrin and identifies that the near neutral iron-binding site initially surrenders its iron to these cells.	This proposal was based on the observed expansion of montmorillonite to 23 A, and the decreases in amount of a second-protein lysozyme adsorbed with extended incubation times of glucose oxidase - clay complexes at pH 4.5.	The effect of timolol versus propranolol on hypertension, hemodynamics, and plasms renin activity was evaluated in 20 men.	Equipotent doses of timolol and propranolol caused similar marked depression of plasma renin activity.	The hypotensive action of timolol and of propranolol was unrelated to their effect on plasma renin activity.	Our studies of the acute and chronic effects of treatment with propranolol in hypertensive patients showed that the antihypertensive action of the drug was of later onset than the initial cardio-depressant and renin-suppressive effects and had little relationship to the pre-treatment levels of treatment-induced changes in plasma renin activity (PRA).	Addition of bovine serum albumin (0.1%) reduced the microsomal biosynthesis of prostaglandins by approximately 80%.	Cimetidine had no effect on serum gastrin concentration when intragastric pH was maintained at 5.0, but when pH was allowed to seek its own level, serum gastrin concentration was higher after cimetidine than after placebo.	A method for covalent coupling of bilirubin to albumin is described.	Human serum albumin-bilirubin (1:1 complex) has been treated with water soluble carbodiimide in order to obtain covalent coupling of bilirubin to albumin.	Sequential determinations of glucose outflow and inflow, and rates of gluconeogenesis from alanine, before, during and after insulin-induced hypoglycemia were obtained in relation to alterations in circulating epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone in six normal subjects.	Insulin decreased the mean (+/-SEM) plasma glucose from 89+/-3 to 39+/-2 mg/dl 25 min after injection, but this decline ceased despite serum insulin levels of 153+/-22 mul/ml.	Before insulin, glucose inflow and outflow were constant averaging 125.3+/-7.1 mg/kg per h. 15 min after insulin, mean glucose outflow increased threefold, but then decreased at 25 min, reaching a rate 15% less than the preinsulin rate.	A fourfold increase in mean plasma epinephrine was found 20 min after insulin, with maximal levels 50 times basal.	Plasma norepinephrine concentrations first increased significantly at 25 min after insulin, whereas significantly increased levels of cortisol and glucagon occurred at 30 min, and growth hormone at 40 min after insulin.	On the other hand, in the liver perfused with insulin, the levels of the energy charge and adenine nucleotide quotient increased to a significant degree as compared to the liver without insulin (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively).	It is suggested that insulin plays an important role as a portal factor in regulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and the levels of the phosphorylated adenine nucleotides.	The linear free energy-related model for structure activity relations developed by Hansch & Fujita (1964) has been used to correlate the binding of tricylic tranquillizers and antidepressants to human serum albumin (HSA) with hydrophobic and electronic parameters.	Subjects deficient in lactase may experience bloating, cramps and diarrhoea after ingesting milk, due to the unhydrolysed and poorly-absorbed lactose.	Responses of the bladder to acetylcholine were potentiated by DFP, edrophonium, BW284C51 and physostigmine but were unaffected by the specific butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor iso-OMPA.	The results demonstrated that increases of systolic arterial pressure, plasma renin activity, and permeability of the retinal vessels were found in 4 operated monkeys.	Generally there was a rough parallelism among levels of plasma renin activity and systolic blood pressure, an increase of permeability of retinal vessels and fibrinoid angionecrosis and/or necrotizing angitis similar to polyarteritis nodosa.	These results support the view that beta-adrenergic blockade by propranolol reduces the severity of ARF by preventing the post-hypoxic release of renin.	Anti-Ig antibodies (or Fab) were coupled by this procedure to peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, lactoperoxidase, glucose oxidase and beta-galactosidase, and the conjugates obtained were found to be highly effective in detecting intracellular Ig by immunohistochemical techniques.	When supplemented with albumin, glucose, serum, and yeast extract, the new medium adequately supported the growth of Mycoplasma and Acholeplasma species.	It was inhibited by heavy metals, sodium dodecyl sulphate, urea and compounds that react with the thiol groups, and was activated by Zn2+, Na+, 2-mercaptoethanol, human albumin and gamma-globulin.	Various complexes of myoglobin (Mb) with thiolate were studied by use of magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy.	The effects of metoprolol, a selective beta adrenergic receptor antagonist, on blood pressure, beta receptor blockade (antagoinst of isoproterenol and exercise tachycardia), and plasma renin activity (PRA) have been compared with those of placebo in 16 patients with essential hypertension.	Standing pulse rate and body weight were higher and plasma renin activity lower during prazosin treatment.	Six men and nine women were given intravenous injections of 2.5 mg of metoclopramide to assess its potential as a stimulus to prolactin release.	Following the administration of metoclopramide, there was prompt increase in serum prolactin to a peak response of 38.2 +/- 3.9 ng/ml in men and 103 +/- 10.2 ng/ml in women.	The prolactin response to metoclopramide in men was compared with the response to 400 mug of TRH in 10 men.	Pretreatment with 500 mg of L-dopa suppressed the prolactin response to metoclopramide in 6 men to a mean response of 16.3 +/- 4.3 ng/ml.	We have concluded that metoclopramide is a safe, reliable, and potent stimulus of prolactin secretion and exerts this effect by blocking dopamine receptors in the hypothalamus and decreasing prolactin inhibiting factor.	Hemodynamic studies (using (131)I-labeled albumin [RISA]) Were performed before and 5 and 42 weeks after the oral administration of pindolol (av.	Blood urea nitrogen, urine osmolarity, total serum protein, serum albumin, and serum globulin varied directly with the quantity of protein in the diet: F2, F4 greater than F1, F3 greater than BM.	Bleaching of rhodopsin is accompanied by significant uptake of heat energy, vastly in excess of the energy required for simple isomerization of the retinal chromophore.	This leads to a model involving intramolecular protonation of the Schiff base nitrogen in the retinal-opsin linkage of rhodopsin, which is consistent with the thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of the system.	Spectro-photometric titrations of the tyrosine residues of hemopexin, heme-hemopexin and hemopexin in 8 M urea showed apparent pK values at 11.4, 11.7, and 10.9 respectively.	At pH 6.8 Zn2+ had no effect on the 19F magnetic resonance spectrum, however, citrate and acetate ions significantly sharpened the signal from the trifluoroacetyl probe at the N-terminal end (glycine A-1) of the insulin A chain.	The results suggested differential alterations in the environments of the probes located at glycine A-1, phenylalanine B-1, and lysine B-29 in the insulin molecule as the concentration of perturbant was increased.	Methylene blue immobilized on porous glass beads was used to catalyze the photooxidation of methionine alone and the methionine residues of lysozyme.	A solution of 2 mM methionine in 50% acetic acid was oxidized to methionine sulfoxide in the presence of immobilized methylene blue after 6 h of photooxidation at 37 degrees C. Selective photooxidation of the methionyl residues in lysozyme was achieved after 26 h of reaction in 84% acetic acid at 4 degrees C. The specific activity of lysozyme exposed to light in the presence of methylene blue decreased by 94%, while that of a lysozyme solution in the presence of methylene blue not exposed to light decreased by 21%.	There was not significant difference between propranolol and metoprolol, which both potentiated the initial hypoglycaemic action of the insulin and delayed the return to normoglycaemia.	Furthermore, this hypotensive action of propranolol was not associated with either adrenergic neruron blockade or changes in plasma renin activity.	These results indicate that the initial hypotensive action of propranolol in mongrel dogs is not due to the blockade of beta-receptors, alterations in peripheral sympathetic nervous transmission or plasma renin activity.	The effect of endogenous and exogenous secretin on fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations in peripheral venous blood was studied.	This increment did not influence insulin or glucose concentration.	Control experiments with intragastric instillation of 300 ml of isotonic saline did not influence the plasma concentration of secretin, insulin or glucose.	In four other non-diabetic persons no significant changes were found in plasma insulin or glucose concentration during an i.v.	The results suggest that secretin is without effect on insulin secretion in the fasting normal subject.	Phenoxybenzamine and propranolol were shown to be specific for their respective adrenergic receptors and to not affect the actions of glucagon or exogenous cAMP.	Neither epinephrine (10-7 M), phenylephrine (10-5 M), nor glucagon (10-7 M) inactivated glycogen synthase in liver cells from fed rats.	In hepatocytes from fasted animals, the glycogen synthase activity ratio was 0.32 +/- 0.03, and epinephrine, glucagon, and phenylephrine were able to lower this significantly.	Phenylephrine (10-5 M) and glucagon (5 x 10(-10) M) decreased by one-half the fall in phosphoryalse alpha activity seen with 10 mM glucose and markedly suppressed the elevation of glycogen synthase activity.	When doses of glucagon, epinephrine, and phenylephrine which produced the same stimulation of glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis were added to the same batches of cells, there were marked rises in cAMP with glucagon, minimal increases with epinephrine, and little or no changes with phenylephrine, indicating that the two catecholamine stimulated these processes largely by mechanisms not involving cAMP accumulation.	The increase in the activity ratio of the kinase with 10(-5) M phenylephrine was much smaller than that produced by a glycogenolytically equivalent dose of glucagon.	The changes in protein kinase induced by phenylephrine and the blockers and by glucagon were thus consistent with those in cAMP.	The inhibition of plasma renin activity (PRA) was more pronounced with propranolol (-69%) than with bufuralol (-47%).	The blood pressure lowering effects of bufuralol in benign essential hypertension seem to be independent of renin and may be related, at least partly, to diminished free peripheral noradrenaline levels.	Phallolysin is not inhibited by serum, albumin, cholesterol, lecithin, cephalin or sphingomyelin; inhibition by red cell ghosts of phallolysin haemolysis is considerably less than that of digitonin haemolysis.	The circadian rhythms of liver glycogen, plasma glucose, corticosterone and insulin, and hepatic activity of PK, G6PDH, ME, Ac, CoA carbox.	Plasma levels of chlorpromazine (CPZ), 3 of its metabolites and prolactin were measured repeatedly in 18 chronic schizophrenic patients.	Sleep stages and release patterns for growth hormone (GH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin were evaluated in two subjects during a three week period in which flurazepam 30 mg was administered nightly.	Thus, the decrease in slow wave sleep produced by administering flurazepam 30 mg was not accompanied by any clear cut changes in GH, LH or prolactin.	20-150 mg of subcutaneous fat is incubated in an albumin buffer containing a physiological spectrum and concentration of fatty acids and glucose.	Today we are mainly interested in the interaction between intermediary metabolism and incretory intestinal function; this is characterized by the joint action of conventional glandular hormones such as insulin and pancreatic glucagon as well as by the incretion of diffuse intestinal organs, hormones such as secretin, pancreozymin, motilin, VIP and GIP.	GIP ("gastric inhibitory peptide"), apart form acting upon the intestinal tract, also causes a marked rise in insulin production; this GIP possibly is the factor responsible for the difference in glucose tolerance following i. v. or oral administration of glucose, something that scientists have been trying to discover for a long time.	Since somatostatin inhibits insulin secretion and especially glucagon release as well as the exretory functions of the stomach and of the pancreas, the significance of this hormone possibly is that of a tissue hormone with inhibitory action on adjacent cells.	The possible therapeutic significance of somatostatin administration to diabetics would lie in the saving of insulin.	Addition of the alpha-adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine or norepinephrine, significantly increased renin release (P less than 0.01 vs. control) while decreasing tissue cAMP levels (P less than 0.01 vs. control).	In contrast, addition of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol markedly increased cAMP levels (P less than 0.01 vs. control) and decreased renin release (P less than 0.05 vs. control).	Non-primate growth-hormone preparations (ovine, bovine, porcine and rat) and non-related hormones (insulin, thyrotropin, lutropin and follitropin) all showed negligible competition.	Further, at this pH, dissociation of the thyrotropin from its receptor was also complex, suggesting the presence of two first order reactions, one with a half-time similar to that seen at pH 6.0 and another with a half-time of 4 h. At both pH 6.0 and 7.5, insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, and prolactin were without effect on [125I]thyrotropin binding.	In short term studies there was a fall in plasma renin by 4 hours after oral administration of penbutolol 2-4 mg, which persisted for 24 hours.	Prolonged treatment with penbutolol 20-30 mg twice daily inhibited renin production under basal conditions and following submaximal work, as well as lowered basal urinary aldosterone excretion.	The effect of insulin-induced hypoglycemia on the blood levels of catecholamines and renin activity has been studied in five patients with moderate hypertension before and after treatment for 3 - 8 months with penbutolol (PEN) 20 - 30 mg twice daily.	Before penbutolol the hypoglycemia-induced increase in catecholamine production caused no change in plasma renin activity in the three patients with low basal levels, whereas a marked increase was observed in the other two.	Duodenal acidification produced stimulation of pepsin and mucus secretion comparable to that induced by exogenous hormones (secretin and the combination of secretin with cholecystokinin).	In addition, duodenal acidification caused an increase in acid secretion, thus suggesting that, in addition to secretin and cholecystokinin, a factor that stimulates acid secretion was also released by acid.	Their lesions have been reported to contain increased amounts of the neurohumors, acetylcholine and norepinephrine, as well as increased activity of acetylcholinesterase and catechol-O-methyltransferase.	A brisk increase in plasma prolactin levels occurred in normal subjects during the administration of chlorpromazine and thyroid stimulating hormone releasing factor (TRH).	In many of these disorders a significant reduction in the plasma prolactin concentration was observed following oral administration of bromocriptine.	Spores of Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14581, subjected to partial-cell iradiation, were exposed to either lysozyme, H2O2, or glucose in an attempt to reduce or eliminate the nonmonotonic behavior in curves of percentage of germination versus energy, obtained when such spores were resuspended in phosphate buffer alone.	We conclude that incorporation of iodine atoms in the tyrosyl residues of glucagon has two major effects: (i) the iodine atom increases hydrophobic interaction of the hormone with the receptor and (ii) ionization of the phenoxy groups results in the loss of biological activity possibly as the result of loss of hydrogen bonding capability.	with insulin freed of zinc and proinsulin, account being taken of the composition dependence of activity coefficients.	The glucose induction of glucokinase following a fast is increased by chronic lithium treatment but diminished by acute treatment.	The cardiotonic potency for AP-A was equivalent to that of isoproterenol but much greater than that for ouabain or glucagon on the isolated cardiac muscle.	Acid secretion stimulated by gastrin or pentagastrin is also inhibited by these drugs, but there is disagreement about the effects of these drugs on acid secretion resulting from activation of acetylcholine receptors.	A comparison was made of the capacity of native beef insulin and its triacetyl derivative to stimulate glucose oxidation by epididymal fat pads.	The binding was specific in that it was prevented by unlabeled thyrotropin or cholera toxin, but not by insulin, glucagon, prolactin, growth hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, or luteinizing hormone.	There was no significant difference between cimetidine and control tests in terms of pepsin output or serum gastrin concentrations.	dose of cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg body weight) the activity of different "brush border enzymes" (maltase, sucrase lactase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase) and of a lysosomal enzyme (acid phosphatase) did not change.	An increase in plasma potassium concentration may reduce plasma renin concentration, but this appeared to be overruled by the stimulating effect of sodium depletion.	To examine whether beta-adrenergic stimulation contributes to the increase in plasma renin concentration during sodium depletion, the relationship between plasma renin concentration and concurrent sodium excretion was studied during beta-receptor blockade with propranolol.	In the new system, all patients, except the elderly and those with congestive heart failure, bradycardia or a history of asthma, are treated first with propranolol alone, a procedure which will diminish or normalize blood pressure in many patients with high and noraml renin levels.	The authors sensitized guinea pigs to a halothane catabolite, trifluoroacetic acid, combined with guinea pig albumin.	Swelling activates the mitochondrial glutaminase I pathway as evidenced by the rise in ammonia produced per glutamine utilized ratio as well as by the accelerated rate of CO2 production derived from the oxidative disposal of glutamin's carbon skeleton.	Freezing of the mitochondria also activated the lipase and this activation was dependent upon the freezing method, the concentration of mitochondrial protein and the presence of bovine serum albumin.	The relationship between the serum gastrin and calcium concentrations has been examined in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type I.	Variations in gastrin concentrations were induced by metiamide and secretin; calcium concentrations were altered by parathyroidectomy and by calcium infusion.	Changes in the serum gastrin concentrations were not accompanied by changes in the serum calcium concentration.	However, alteration of the serum calcium was accompanied by significant parallel changes in the serum gastrin.	It is concluded that acute changes in the serum calcium may induce changes in the serum gastrin.	It is postulated that the thyro-parathyroid hormones may modulate the relationship between calcium and gastrin.	Treatment consisted of continuous insulin infusion (6 IU soluble insulin/hour), physiological saline, potassium substitution and sodium bicarbonate (if the pH was below 7.15).	In the first hours of treatment 98 +/- 12IU of insulin, 6.5 +/- 0.5 litres of fluid, 168 +/- 22 mmol of potassium and 237 +/- 55 mmol NaHCO3 were required.	During the first 4 hours of the insulin infusion the blood sugar decrease per hour was 3.55 mmol/l (0.64 g/l).	Although albumin alone produced a decrease in ionized calcium, the addition of albumin to whole blood did not result in a greater decline than that experienced with whole blood alone.	Induction of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase by allylisopropylacetamide in organ-cultured chick embryo liver was not appreciably influenced by any of cycli AMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, theophylline, glucose, insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, isoproterenol, and hydrocortisone, whereas the activity of tyrosine aminotransferase significantly increased in response to cyclic AMP and some of those hormones.	The efficiency of washing liquid-stored red blood cells and red blood cells frozen with high or low glycerol concentrations was evaluated by measuring the recovery of red blood cells in vitro, supernatant hemoglobin, extracellular potassium and red blood cell potassium levels, supernatant osmolality, residual 125I albumin, glycerol, hypoxanthine, and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) levels.	It was not affected by amiloride, vasopressin, cAMP, and thyroxine, but stimulated by insulin.	Regulation by pH, potassium, and epinephrine and suggested, as is the existence of a two-pool system for insulin synthesis and release which is responsive to glucose.	Differences in glucose and insulin responses following a second episode of shock are noted.	It was applied to mixtures of adenine nucleotides, Mg2+ and other ions relevant to the study of glucokinase (EC 2.7.1.2), but the qualitative conclusions are not peculiar to this system.	The mitochondrial ferrochelatase activity has been studied in coupled rat liver mitochondria using deuteroporphyrin IX (incorporated into liposomes of lecithin) and Fe(III) or Co(II) as the substrates.	The average affinity of transferrin for iron depended on species, but the variation was never more than about one order of magnitude.	The relative binding of iron by ovotranferrin and human transferrin was affected little when bicarbonate anion was replaced by oxalate, although the ratio of the two binding constants for ovotranferrin increased.	Despite intensive treatment with insulin and glucose and careful correction of the acidosis with bicarbonate four of the ten patients died.	In vitro addition of rat insulin (200, 400 or 800 muU/ml) to collagenase-isolated pancreatic islets of adult rats diminished glucose (3 mg/ml)-induced insulin release which was correlated with a decrease of the ratio of total NADPH/NADP and inhibition of glucose oxidation via the pentose phosphate shunt (PPS).	Sustained, 60-minute perfusion of glibenclamide (0.5, 1.5 and 10 mug/ml) elicits a one-phase insulin release profile, formed by a rapid secretion peak followed by a second peak with lower insulin levels than the former.	Concurrent stimulation with glucose (100, 150, 200 and 300 mg%) plus glibenclamide (1 mug/ml) causes a marked rise in both phases of insulin secretion.	The increase in insulin secretion caused by glibenclamide is not inhibited by puromycin.	Both theophylline and phentolamine modify and increase the glibenclamide-induced insulin release pattern.	Glibenclamide and glucose induce secretion of insulin originating in the same compartment.	Other degradative enzymes isolated from human granulocytes, e.g., collagenase and lysozyme, did not potentiate MPO-H2O2-mediated or cationic protein-dependent bacterial killing.	A similar increase in c-GMP in the liver was also found in rats in vivo 15 min after infusion of TGH solution (a mixture of triiodothyronine, glucagon, and heparin).	It migrated before albumin in cellulose acetate electrophoresis and did not form any precipitin line with the crude venom or with purified phospholipase A in immunodiffusin tests.	A new assay procedure for triglyceride lipase [EC 3.1.1.3] was developed in which radioactive triolein was dissolved in ethanol and directly added to the reaction mixture in the absence of serum and albumin.	H2O2 was found to activate guanylate cyclase, either by its generation in the lung supernatant with glucose oxidase and glucose, or by its addition to a preparation in which the catalase was inhibited with KCN.	KCN or bovine serum albumin was able to partially inhibit activation by glucose oxidase plus glucose, however, larger amounts of glucose oxidase could overcome that inhibition, indicating a catalytic role for Cu2+ at low H2O2 concentrations.	The Cepsilon methyl group of the 2 methionine residues in sperm whale myoglobin was enriched with respect to 13C.	The appropriate -Pro-X- bonds in zinc-free porcine insulin, oxytocin, arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II, bradykinin-potentiating factor were cleaved.	The effects of insulin, cortisol, and epinephrine on general protein synthesis, and specifically on fibrinogen and albumin synthesis, have been tested on cells from both normal rats and adrenalectomized rats.	The combination of cortisol and epinephrine strongly depresses albumin synthesis in both types of cells.	The influence of amitryptiline, theophylline and furosemide on the concentration of cyclic-AMP and plasma renin activity (PRA) was investigated in renal vein plasma.	Isolated rat liver mitochondria accumulate iron from the suspending medium when [59Fe]transferrin is used as a model compound.	The results indicate that the energy-dependent accumulation of [59Fe]transferrin represents a process by which mitochondria accumulate iron from transferrin.	For certain enzymes, such as acid beta-glycerophosphatase, alpha-galactosidase, acid lipase, lysozyme and phospholipase A2, the pH-dependent behaviour obtained in the presence of heparin was quite different to that obtained with chondroitin sulphate, suggesting the existence of physicochemical characteristic factors playing a role in the intermolecular interaction for each of the sulphated glycosaminoglycans studied.	Plasma insulin concentrations in fed rats were altered acutely by administration of glucose or anti-insulin serum.	No lipolytic activity was detected in pouch secretions collected during 1 h after feeding, though lipolytic activity was present in abomasal contents; pepsin (EC 3.4.23.1) and renin (EC 3.4.23.4) were present in both pouch secretions and abomasal contents.	glucagon, melittin, insulin A and B chain, bradykinin, angiotensin I and II, oxytocin ACTH, clupein and salmin.	Similarly to pancreatic lipase but contrary to liver esterase, it is inhibited by bile salts; relief of this inhibition by colipase is only observed for pancreatic lipase.	On the other hand, insulin and its A chain, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), oxytocin and vasopressin were cleaved slowly.	Holo- and apotyrosine aminotransferase were induced in both control and deficient rats by injecting them with glucagon or with dexamethasone phosphate.	Thus results have been shown only for diazepam and chlordiazepoxid, which indicate an effect of the plasma protein binding on distribution and pharmacological activity, for example the existence of a direct correlation between unwanted CNS depressions and low plasma albumin concentrations and a direct correlation between the plasma protein binding and the biological half-life.	The effect of CO at a concentration of 10 to 45 mg/m3 on the content of carboxyhemoglobin in the blood, nonhemoglobin iron in the plasma, CO in the breathing air, catalase and peroxidase activity was studied.	After subcutaneous infusion of the gastric secretagogues, pentagastrin + carbachol, there was a six-hour period of gastric hypersecretion, but no change in plasma and G-cell gastrin.	Hemodynamic and renin studies at rest and during graded upright ergometry were performed in 21 patients with essential hypertension before and after propranolol.	The degree of the individual hemodynamic changes after propranolol correlated better with the corresponding control values than with age or renin.	Pharmacological agents such as apomorphine and many of the ergot alkaloids are very effective inhibitors of the secretion of prolactin.	Still other pharmacological agents such as DMPEA, alpha-methyldopa, reserpine, and certain of the phenothiazines are very effective in causing a stimulation of prolactin secretion.	They showed that, 24 hours after the last insulin injection and under basal conditions, the glucose concentrations increased because glucose production exceeded glucose utilization.	The absence of C-peptide in the plasma indicated that changes in glucose turnover were not related to any changes in endogenous plasma insulin.	Furthermore, the plasma glucagon concentration increased and, hence, changes in this hormone could not account for the decrease in glucose production.	Interdigestive gastirc acid output and acid secretory response to histamine, insulin  and pentagastrin were studied in five dogs before and after creation of a right to left extracardiac vascular shunt.	As far as STH, or growth hormone, free fatty acids and insulin are concerned, one may note a rise with associations containing droperidol even in the absence of any stress and stability with  a mixture of chlorprotixene and dextromoramide.	Norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) levels were measured in human brain tissue obtained at autopsy from a series of 39 patients dying of various medical and accidental causes.	The Km for glucose of pea-seed glucokinase was 70 muM and the Km for mannose was 0.5 mM.	Four enzymes necessary for the metabolism of methionine by the trans-sulfuration pathway, methionine adenosyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.6), adenosylhomocysteinase (EC 3.3.1.1), cystathionine beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (EC 4.4.1.1) were identified in Tetrahymean pyriformis.	Further, a sensitized oligomerization of albumin was observed, independent of oxidation of the histidine residues, and not consuming oxygen.	Irradiation of a complex of human serum albumin with one molecule of bound bilirubin, in the absence of a sensitizing dye, resulted in a fast, non-oxygen consuming process whereby the light absorption maximum of the pigment was shifted 4 nm towards longer wavelength and part of the bilirubin was converted to a more polar pigment, bound less firmly to the protein.	In an attempt to detect the existence of histaminergic mechanisms in the regulation of prolactin secretion in rats, the effects of histidine and histamine-receptor antagonists (chlorpheniramine and metiamide) on plasma prolactin levels in urethan-anesthetized rats were investigated in relation to other aminergic mechanisms.	The influence of cimetidine on the lower esophageal sphincter, the intragastric pH and the serum levels of immunoreactive gastrin was investigated in eight volunteers and compared with a control group.	The histidine decarboxylase stimulating activity of high doses of cimetidine was not abolished by gastric perfusion with acid suggesting that endogenously released gastrin is not involved.	Lower esophageal sphincter pressure, basal gastric pH, fasting plasma gastrin, and plasma concentrations of estrone, estradiol, and progesterone were measured in pregnant volunteers at 12, 24, and 36 weeks of gestation, and again at 1 to 4 weeks postpartum.	It has previously been shown, that large differences exist between the effects of 6-aminohexanoic acid or alpha1-antitrypsin on fibrinolysis caused by a porcine tissue plasminogen activator or by human urokinase, while insignificant differences exist between the effects of a number of natural protease inhibitors on fibrinolysis caused by the two types of plasminogen activator.	The present study shows that changes in substrate composition (pH, ionic strength fibrinogen concentration, plasminogen concentration) may influence to different degrees the fibrinolytic activities of human urokinase and the porcine tissue plasminogen activator.	Inhibition of binding of tritiated hormone by unlabeled PTH was also highly effective at pH 6.0, but this apparently specific binding was also inhibited by adrenocorticotropic hormone, insulin, glucagon, and vasopressin.	Higher concentrations of potassium and magnesium ions were required for the translation of albumin mRNA than for total liver mRNAs.	At the higher potassium or magnesium concentrations, only intact albumin molecules were synthesized, whereas lower concentrations of these ions caused the production of antibody-reactive fragments.	These results support the hypothesis that the dopamine receptors that mediate the effects of dopamine on prolactin secretion are similar to those that mediate the anti-psychotic effect of neuroleptic drugs.	Plasma renin concentration was not found to have a strong predicting power for the hypotensive effect of atenolol or bendrofluazide but low renin patients showed a more pronounced blood pressure decrease on bendrofluazide and high renin patients, especially essential hypertensives, on atenolol.	In four patients of group I, who had high plasma renin activity and had responded to intravenous propranolol, infusion of angiotensin II inhibitor did not lower pressure.	Patients suffering from pheochromocytoma characterized by an exclusive or almost exclusive excess of norepinephrine showed no (one patient) or only a moderate increase (two patients) in renin and aldosterone secretion.	In those three patients with concomitant distinct hypersecretion of epinephrine, renin release (and aldosterone secretion except in one patient) was markedly enhanced.	The results indicate that augmentation in renin release depends on the ratio of the different catecholamines secreted by the pheochromocytoma and their different effe-tiveness in stimulating beta-adrenergic receptors.	In 17 patients with low renin hypertension (group 1), a volume-depleting drug was added (spironolactone, 14 patients; thiazides, 3 patients) and this achieved a marked fall in blood pressure levels of 38/16 mm Hg supine and 37/19 mm Hg standing (both p less than 0.001).	These results suggest the following: (1) Most patients with normal to high plasma renin activity respond well to moderate doses of propranolol.	An intravenous glucose tolerance test has been done measuring glucose and insulin serum levels before and after i.v.	Data obtained in this study demonstrate that: 1. adult rats have a better glucose assimilation and higher insulin serum levels after i.v.	2. run-stress leads to a deterioration of glucose assimilation and diminution of insulin release in rats of any age.	3. run-training improves glucose tolerance and saves insulin at the same time.	5. run-stress after run-training has a different effect on adult and old rats: In adult rats there is nearly no effect on glucose assimilation and insulin release in comparison to control animals, while old rats show a significant deterioration of glucose assimilation in comparison to control rats of the same age.	These interactions were modified by changes in temperature, reduction by ascorbate, hydrolysis by lysozyme, and complexation with the antibiotic, vancomycin.	Degradati on of spin-labeled peptidoglycan by lysozyme eliminated the observed spin-spin exchange and yielded products with a mobility similar to I. Complexation of spin-labeled peptidoglycan with vancomycin resulted in both pronounced free-radical immobilization and a decrease in spin-spin exchange.	Calcium trapped within sonicated and resealed bovine rod outer segment disks is released upon light exposure with a stoichiometry of 0.75 +/- 0.05 calcium for each rhodopsin bleached.	The resluts suggest a model for the disk in which each bleached rhodopsin functions as a "one-shot carrier" to transport a single calcium ion across the membrane.	The effect of insulin, acetylcholine, histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and prostaglandins E1, E2 and F2alpha on basal and adrenalin-stimulated cyclic AMP content in intact pigeon erythrocytes was investigated.	Defatting does not affect the distribution of hemin within the fractions of serum albumin.	Aminoacylase was immobilized on the mycelium pellets of Aspergillus ochraceus by using albumin and glutaraldehyde.	Administrations of atenolol caused a rise in plasma noradrenaline both on lying and after exercise (P less than 0.0125), and a fall in plasma renin concentration (P less than 0.01).	Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which stimulated the release of insulin from toadfish islet cells and from isolated secretion granules, was taken up by the membranes prepare from these secretion granules.	Oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, which did not release insulin from the granules, was taken up to a much lesser extent.	Various inhibitory peptides based on tetradecapeptide renin substrate have been useful in renin kinetic studies and in renin affinity chromatography.	Gastric acid seretion was stimulated by a standard steak meal, human synthetic gastrin, and betazole hydrochloride.	Adenoma insulin content correlated with increments of plasma insulin after tolbutamide administration.	The data indicate: 1) insulin-secreting islet cell tumors have decreased storage capacity for insulin, 2) elevated concentration of proinsulin in tumors may be due to decreased capacity to store insulin and in some to decreased conversion of proinsulin to insulin as well, 3) tolbutamide stimulates the exaggerated release of a relatively constant fraction of insulin stored in adenomas.	Neither the protein activator factor nor catalase which is required for sodium azide effects altered the stimulatory effect of sodium nitroprusside.	Changes in blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and hemodynamic components were studied in 23 patients with essential hypertension treated with oral pindolol or propranolol.	The effects of varying levels of exercise on oxygen uptake, CO2 production, blood pressure, arterial blood gasses, and arterial concentrations of glucose, insulin, and growth hormone were examined in ten normal weight and ten moderately overweight young men.	In immunohistochemical studies of rat liver tissue slices and purified nuclei, adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) immunofluorescence on the nuclear membrane are sequentially increased after glucagon administration.	Since pseudopregnancy implies a rise of prolactin secretion, our results indirectly indicate that PIF secretion is stimulated by dopamine.	Acid-reflux studies were carried out in 10 healthy subjects in the basal state, during continuous infusion of pentagastrin (0.015 mug/kg body-weight) after bolus injection of insulin (0.2 IU/kg bodyweight), and after intragastric instillation of 200 ml hydrochloric acid.	These values were not affected by the presence of ouabain (0.1 mM), mannoheptulose (5 mM), or insulin (1 mU/ml), whereas phloridzin produced a drastic inhibition of glucose utilzation showing an apparent Ki of 0.4 mM.	Large fragments of human serum albumin were produced by treatment of the native protein with pepsin at pH3.5.	The distribution of large fragments of human albumin digested with pepsin in the above pH region was critically dependent on pH.	The plasminogen activator shares many properties with urokinase including: molecular weight (55 000), isoelectric point (8.7), heat stability (60 degrees C, 30 min), PH stability (1.5-10), and its mode of activation of plasminogen.	With D-leucine, the best substrate for O2 consumption, 1 mol of ammonia is formed for half a mol of O2 consumed in the presence of catalase.	The specificity of elastase is probably the same, since in elastin both enzymes hydrolyze the peptide bonds, formed by the NH2-group of glycine and alanine residues, found in elastin in large amounts.	Physico-chemical properties of trypsin covalently bound with human serum albumin by glutaric aldehyde have been studied.	MTW9-P, an ovariectomy-responsive tumor developed in rats maintained on daily perphenazine injections, had 4-fold-higher prolactin binding than had MTW9MtT, an ovariectomy-nonresponsive tumor developed in rats bearing the mammosomatotropic pituitary tumor, MtTW10.	Withdrawal of perphenazine from rats bearing MTW9-P caused a fall to normal of plasma prolactin, no tumor regression, and no significant change in prolactin binding.	The cellulose isothiocyanate was characterized by its binding capacity with respect to [14C]-glycine, [131 I]-human serum albumin, and 2-mercaptoethanol.	Each agent was evaluated at concentrations ranging from 10-8 to 10-5 m and three different dose-response curve patterns were observed: (1) Metoprolol, acebutolol, labetalol, and d-propranolol had no effect on isoproterenol-stimulated renin release at any concentration, whereas pindolol and bufuralol demonstrated minimal inhibition at 10-5 m only.	(3) Dose-related inhibition was observed with practolol, oxprenolol, timolol, nadolol, and atenolol at concentrations ranging from 10-8 to 10-5 m. Basal renin release was significantly (P is less than 0.01) inhibited by angiotensin II at 10-6 m, which also inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated renin release in a dose-related fashion.	Elevation of cyclic AMP concentrations produced by glucagon and by theophylline in isolated myocytes was attenuated by phenylephrine and by epinephrine plus propranolol and the attenuation was antagonized by phentolamine.	The concentration of 65Zn in the ventral prostate was not changed by orchiectomy, adrenalectomy, or the administration of estradiol benzoate, prolactin release inhibiors, or cyproterone acetate.	The results suggest an important role for prolactin in the zinc uptake in the dorsolateral prostate but not in the ventral prostate.	In order to find out if similar differences exist in the isolated protomers of Hb A we have measured the effect of various pressures of carbon dioxide (pCO2) on the oxygen affinity in the following heme pigments: isolated alpha and beta subunits with free --SH groups (alphaSH, betaSH), mercurated beta subunits (betaPMB), myoglobin (Mb), and betaSH/PLP in which the terminal alpha-amino group of betaSH was irreversibly blocked with pyridoxal phosphate (PLP).	After a single intravenous injection most of the reserpine, probably loosely bound to plasma albumin, is distributed to tissues on the basis of their blood flow.	We conclude that there may exist a diminished release of gastrointestinal hormones such as secretin and cholecystokinin in certain duodenal ulcer patients.	An experiment where perfused rat hearts receiving no substrate are suddenly given glucose with insulin in the perfusate is simulated with a computer model of cardiac energy metabolism.	In addition, plasma renin activity (PRA) at rest and plasma levels of penbutolol and propranolol were determined.	To examine the direct effects of dopamine on renin release, the in vitro rat kidney slice system, devoid of hemodynamic and humoral effects, was chosen.	In the presence of an antioxidant, ascorbic acid (6 X 10(-4)M), a significant dose-related stimulation of renin release was observed with addition of 10(-5)M and higher concentrations of dopamine.	When the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, pheniprazine (1 X 10(-5)M) was added, significant, dose-related stimulation of renin release was observed with 10(-8)M and higher concentrations of dopamine.	Dopamine-induced renin release was not inhibited by the presence of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine (9 X 10(-4)M), the dopaminergic antagonist, haloperidol (5 X 10(-5)M) or the neural uptake inhibitor, cocaine (1 X 10(-5)M).	However, the presence of the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol (2 X 10(-4)M) completely inhibited dopamine-induced renin release.	These studies indicate that dopamine can directly stimulate renin release in the absence of effects of hemodynamic factors, alterations in sodium metabolism or release of endogenous adrenergic agents.	Further, this direct effect of dopamine on renin release appears to be mediated by an agonistic effect on the juxtaglomerular beta receptor rather than by the presence of a specific dopaminergic receptor for renin release.	However, the administration of hormones which alter the blood glucose levels considerably (insulin, tolbutamide, glucagon and hydrocortisone) did not influence the enzyme activity.	They also show that different lipogenic enzymes are not regulated via the same 'operon' since thyroxine or glucagon which alter the level of some enzymes on this pathway did not modify that of the acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase.	These findings lend support to the hypothesis that interactions among histamine, gastrin and acetylcholine receptors do occur though the degree would not be the same in all directions.	Activity of agmatinase (EC 3.5.3.11) from Proteus vulgaris was studied in presence of guanidine derivatives of agmatine as substrates.	Compounds, containing an amino- or guanidine group at the position opposite to the guanidine end and possessing the hydrocarbon chain not less that C4 were shown to be substrates of agmatinase.	The inhibitory effect of glucagon on pancreatic exocrine secretion induced by endogenously released secretin was studied in 4 dogs with chronic pancreatic fistulas and open gastric fistulas.	It is concluded that the inhibitory effect of glucagon on pancreatic secretion is not mediated through inhibition of secretin release.	The chemical homology between glucagon and secretin suggests that glucagon may mediate its inhibitory action by competing with secretin at the level of the pancreatic receptor site.	In all nine patients with marked gastrin responses to secretin, the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome was diagnosed by gastric acid hypersecretion and large increases in gastrin after calcium administration.	In 34 normal subjects, 23 nonaffected members of families with MEA I-syndrome, and 42 patients with various diseases the maximum gastrin response to secretin was 21 pg/ml.	We conclude that secretin provocation is helpful in the diagnosis of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, especially when basal serum gastrin levels are only slightly elevated.	Central inhibition of DA synthesis by metyrosine was suggested, however, by (1) the development of extrapyramidal side effects and (2) a significant increase in plasma prolactin concentrations.	(b) The deposition of 65Zn in the rat dorsolateral gland, particularly as affected by prolactin and testosterone, and the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on such deposition.	In view of the above results, it can be suggested that, among several possible causes, alterations in the binding-affinity of calcium ions to serum albumin can be excluded as an additional factor of secondary hyperparathyroidism in uremia.	Duodenal bicarbonate output and pH were recorded and plasma secretin and motilin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay.	This fall was linearly correlated with pancreatic bicarbonate output, whereas a non-linear correlation was observed between plasma motilin and both plasma secretin level and duodenal pH.	The pH dependence of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum and oxygen affinity of cobaltous porphyrin-containing myoglobin (CoMb) have been examined.	Gastric acid, pancreatic bicarbonate, serum gastrin, and plasma secretin were measured.	Acidification of the meal evoked a pH-dependent reduction of gastrin and gastric acid secretion, a pH-dependent elevation of pancreatic bicarbonate, and significant elevation of secretin at pH 3 (43% above basal) and at pH 2 (80% above basal).	Ammonia production per glutamine extracted increased from 1.33 +/- 0.07 in control to 1.79 +/- 0.08 in kidneys from hormone-treated rats, suggesting stimulation of the mitochondrial glutaminase I-glutamate dehydrogenase pathway; this was supported by a proportional rise in production of glucose and CO2, end products of glutamine's carbon skeleton.	glucose tolerance test a pathological glucose assimilation and diminished insulin secretion in comparison to control rats of the same age after a maximal run-stress.	Bilirubin binds to fragments P44 and P29, and the complexes show similar circular-dichroism spectra to that of the complex between bilirubin and whole albumin.	Guanosine (1-100 micron) inhibited glucose, tolbutamide, theophylline and prostaglandin E2-stimulated insulin secretion although it failed to affect glucagon stimulated secretion.	In response to parenteral nutrition, plasma glucose, insulin, and venous lactate concentration increased and free fatty acid decreased.	Because propranolol is contraindicated in some patients and since clonidine can decrease heart rate and renin release, clonidine was substituted for propranolol in 14 severely hypertensive minoxidil-treated outpatients.	GMP synthetase exhibits glutaminase activity when ATP is replaced by adenosine plus PPi.	Intravenous administration of cimetidine, a histamine (H2) receptor antagonist, provoked an immediate 2 to 3-fold rise in serum prolactin concentrations in 8 normal men; serum thyrotropin, growth hormone, thyroxine, and triiodothyronine were not significantly affected.	Noradrenaline, insulin, and heparin have no effect on the serum-stimulated lipolytic activity.	Conditions are studied for Penicillium vitale catalase dissociation into subunits under the effect of urea (0.7-8.5 M) and acid pH (5.0-2.0).	In 8.0 M urea (pH 5.0) a molecule of the P. vitale catalase dissociates with formation of the components, the sedimentation coefficient of which is 2.4+/-0.2S, the molecular weight is 153000+/-2800.	Dissociation at pH 2.2 in 4.0 M urea results in formation of components with the sedimentation coefficient 2.2+/-0.3 S. The catalase molecule dissociation under the mentioned conditions is accompanied by a loss in the enzyme activity.	At the same time the catalase after dissociation in 8.0-8.5 M urea loses its ability to reassociation with a decrease in the urea concentration up to 0.08 M.	(platelet rich plasma), estimation of the co-factors of the prothrombin complex, thrombin and reptilase times, platelet count, platelet stickiness using the method of HELLEM, platelet aggregation using the method of Born, plasminogen and plasmin activity by the pH STAT method, and P.D.F.	The ability of a large number of cellular metabolites to release iron from transferrin was investigated by measuring the rate at which they could mediate iron exchange between two types of transferrin.	GTP, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, ATP, ADP and citrate produced the most rapid exchange of iron between the two types of transferrin, but many other compounds showed some degree of activity.	The rate of iron exchange from the oxalate - iron - transferrin complex was much lower than from bicarbonate - iron - transferrin.	It is concluded that several organic phosphates have the capacity of releasing iron from transferrin.	beta-Adrenergic responsiveness monitored by plasma cyclic AMP determinations revealed plasma cyclic AMP, renin and circulatory hyperresponsiveness to isoproterenol in borderline hyperadrenergic EH while the opposite, cyclic AMP and renin hyporesponsiveness to insulin-induced hypoglycemia have been described in low renin stable EH.	Treatment of animals with N-methylacetamide, a diabetogen which does not cause insulin deficiency in the animal but rather produces an insulin-resistant state, did not affect the metabolism in vitro of either hexobarbital or aniline.	A close relationship was observed between this decrease of 6PG/G6P ratio and the net insulin release, the absolute rate of glucose oxidation via the pentose phosphate cycle, and the NADPH/NADP ratios measured under similar conditions.	As a result of effective beta adrenergic blockade with either propranolol or practolol, plasma renin activity was suppressed in all of 11 patients with cirrhosis and ascites.	Histamine H2-receptor antagonists (Burimamide, Metiamide and Cimetidine as the most recent generation) may drastically inhibit gastric acid secretion stimulated by histamine, pentagastrin, insulin, 2-deoxyglucose or an intragastrically instilled meal, respectively.	It seems likely that tyrosinase activity is suppressed by the presence of glucose rather than stimulated by galactose.	Velocity sedimentation analysis showed that the peak of colony-forming cells which respond to thyroid hormone and the adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, sedimented at an identical rate (7.54 mm/h), which is slower than the major peak of colony-forming cells responding to erythropoietin alone (8.62 mm/h).	Carbuterol 4 mg produced significant increases in glucose, insulin, lactate, and free fatty acids as well as in pulse rate and arterial pulse pressure.	Metaproterenol produced increases only in plasma glucose and insulin.	The aim of the present investigation was to examine the fetal and maternal blood glucose and insulin response following glucose infusion to the mother.	Glucose concentration, immuno-reactive insulin (IRI), pH and base excess of the maternal and fetal blood were measured before and during maternal glucose load.	The increase of maternal and fetal glucose was associated with an elevation of immuno-reactive insulin (IRI).	The increase of insulin per glucose rise was correlated to fetal body weight.	From these observations it may be concluded that in the human fetus insulin secretion following a single glucose load is generally low, however, it increases in cases where the maternal insulin response to glucose load is abnormal.	A review is presented of recent progress in bilirubin chemistry, its binding to albumin, displacement by drugs, and the mechanism of phototherapy.	At least three substances have been reported to be present in the hypothalamus that can inhibit prolactin release, namely a PIF, catecholamines and acetylcholine.	At least four substances have been reported to be present in the hypothalamus that can stimulate prolactin release, namely PRF, TRH, serotonin and prostaglandins.	However, more work is needed to determine whether or not the effects of GABA or catecholamines on prolactin release are physiological or pharmacological.	Maximum neutral lipid production was obtained when the reaction mixture (400 microliter) consisted of 0.25 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 0.125 mM oleoyl-CoA, 3.75 mM sn-glycerol-3-P, 10 mM MgCl2 and 1.85 mg bovine serum albumin.	The effects of pH, temperature and guanidine hydrochloride concentration on the structure of ubiquitin, a polypeptide which can activate adenylate cyclase and can mimic thymopoietin induced differentiation of prothymocytes, were monitored using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.	500 mg of levodopa was administered orally to 8 normal subjects and induced an increase of growth hormone (GH) and a decrease of prolactin (PRL) secretion.	In the normal anesthetized dog the combination of insulin, whether of exogenous or endogenous origin, with sodium dichloroacetate provoke a rapid and important reduction of the hyperlactatemia and hyperpyruvicemia induced by the intraduodenal injection of high doses of phenformin.	Intravenous injection of isoproterenol increases plasma renin activity (PRA) in anesthetized dogs.	S. 464, a new beta adrenergic blocking agent, injected five minutes before isoproterenol, inhibits plasma renin hyperactivity.	The organic hydroperoxide cumene hydroperoxide is capable of oxidizing ethanol to acetaldehyde in the presence of either catalase, purified cytochrome P-450 or rat liver microsomes.	The cumene-hydroperoxide-dependent ethanol oxidation in microsomes was inhibited partially by cytochrome P-450 inhibitors but was unaffected by catalase inhibitors.	The evidence suggests that cytochrome P-450 rather than catalase is the enzyme responsible for hydroperoxide-dependent ethanol oxidation.	However, when H2O2 is used in place of cumene hydroperoxide, the microsomal ethanol oxidation closely resembles the catalase system.	Prolactin and insulin plasma levels, glycerol, and blood sugar were not significantly influenced by BS 100-141.	The inhibition of the gastric juice secretion occurring against the background of multiple introduction of histamine or gastrin tetrapeptide amide was quite spectacular: the secretion dropped down to zero and the action was more prolonged than following administration of pentagastrin with which the secretion was not inhibited to such a sharp degree and the effect of GMP was less protracted.	In 81 healthy male volunteers with normal blood pressure, normal body weight of different age (18-58 years) an intravenous glucose tolerance test with determination of blood sugar and serum insulin levels was done.	Membranes prepared from adenosine triphosphate-depleted red cells depicted a two to three-fold increase in catalase activity, as well as an increase in 60 000 molecular weight band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.	Purified ferrochelatase is strongly stimulated in the presence of copper.	Other parameters of possible relevance to this finding, such as serum calcium, serum albumin, serum lambda-glutamyltransferase, and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal disorders were analysed, and no correlations to the phosphate level were detected.	Two patients who did not develop significant increases in prolactin levels did show a definite therapeutic response to sulpiride.	Addition of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, an inhibitor of catalase, reduced the formation of formaldehyde to half the amount without change in the amount of oxygen consumed, indicating the synergic action of alcohol oxidase and catalase in methanol oxidation in the microbodies of living yeast cells.	The reaction is not inhibited by benzoate, mannitol, superoxide dismutase, or catalase.	The study showed that antacids elicited significantly greater gastrin responses than their non-buffering chloride compounds and that the rise of gastrin after a single dose of antacid was small but significant in duodenal ulcer patients and insignificant in non-ulcer controls.	Several factors as rising intragastric pH, individual responsiveness, duodenal ulcer state, vagal influences, the participating ions and their amount contribute to the rise of gastrin after antacids.	Suggested explanations include a local inhibitory effect of zinc on abomasal acid secretion elevating duodenal pH and a resultant increased release of gastrin stimulating secretion from the pouches.	H2-Histamine receptor blocking agents metiamide and cimetidine were assessed in seven patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (serum gastrin greater than 300 microgram/ml, basal acid output greater than 15 meq/h, ratio of basal acid output to maximal acid output greater than 0.5).	Simultaneous determination of the rate of appearance of 3H in water from [(1R)-1-3H1] ethanol and the rate of acetaldehyde formation in the presence of rat or ox liver catalase under conditions of steady-state generation of H2O2 allowed calculation of the 3H isotope effect.	The mean value of 2.52 obtained for rat liver catalase at 37 degrees C and pH 6.3-7.7 was independent of both ethanol concentration and the rate of H2O2 generation over a wide range.	The release of iron from transferrin was investigated by incubating the diferric protein in the presence of potential iron-releasing agents.	Neither 1 mM adenosine monophosphate (AMP) nor 1 mM orthophosphate released iron from transferrin.	The rate of iron release rapidly increased as transferrin was titrated with HCl from pH 6.8 to 6.1 in the presence of 1 mM ATP and 160 mM NaCl at 20 degrees C. Iron release from transferrin without ATP was observed below pH 5.5.	Ascorbate (10(-4) M) reduced Fe(III), but only after iron release from transferrin by a physiological concentration of ATP.	A proposal for the mechanism of iron release from transferrin by ATP and the utilization of reduced iron by erythroid cells is described.	Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at pH 7.0 using solutions of bovine insulin containing 2 mol of zinc(II) ions per six base-mol of insulin.	Tyrosine aminotransferase in 8999C cells was induced by dexamethasone but not by N6,O2'-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate or insulin.	First-order kinetics were obtained with elastin as the substrate, provided trypsin was in excess.	Other inducers of tyrosine aminotransferase, such as glucagon and hydrocortisone, also increased the level of tyrosine aminotransferase mRNA in proportion to their effect on enzyme activity.	Besides their well-known actions, glucagon, ACTH, pentagastrin and insulin from the APUD series exert a direct action on the bone calcium content.	After acidification to pH 3.0 or incubation with trypsin, the inactive renin becomes more active and the molecular weight falls to that of active renin.	The stimation of transketolase demonstrates a deficiency in thiamine.	The prolactin response to neuroleptics can serve as an index of dopamine blockade in humans.	Plasma prolactin increments to single doses of chlorpromazine, and prolactin decrements to single doses of levodopa, were similar in normal and schizophrenic subjects.	Plasma insulin concentrations in cold-adapted rats were altered acutely by administration of glucose or anti-insulin serum.	(electron-paramagnetic-resonance) spectra of the fluoride, azide, hydroxide and cyanide complexes of these ferric leghaemoglobins were very similar to the spectra of the corresponding myoglobin derivatives, indicating that the immediate environment of the iron in leghaemoglobin and myoglobin is similar, an imidazole moiety of histidine being the proximal ligand to the haem iron [cf.	Preincubation of the homogenate with 10(-8) M cholecystokinin or secretin inhibited gastrin binding to a greater extent than an equimolar concentration of pentagastrin.	Intravenous infusions of isoprenaline, salbutamol and carbuterol did not affect insulin clearance but increased plasma renin concentration to the same same extent.	After the correction of serum calcium by parathyroidectomy, the gastric acid output and serum gastrin were decreased.	Guanylate cyclase activity was dependent on Mn2+; it was increased by sodium azide (NaN3), CaCl2, cysteine, secretin, and cholecystokinin, but it was not influenced by gastrin, histamine, cholinergic esters, prostaglandins E1 and A1.	The guanylate cyclase activity of that fraction was not modified by NaN3, gastrin, cholinergic agents, secretin, or cholecystokinin.	Cimetidine inhibits basal and nocturnal acid secretion and acid secretion stimulated by histamine, pentagastrin, caffeine, insulin, sham feeding, and food.	Cimetidine has no effect on nocturnal serum gastrin concentration, but, when stimulated by food, serum gastrin concentration is higher after cimetidine than after placebo.	The tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) activity of cultured mouse melanoma cells B16 in the stationary phase of growth, depends greatly on the pH of the medium and the kind of sugar present.	When cultured at a constant pH of 7.2, cells grown with 1 mM galactose had about five times higher tyrosinase activity than cells grown with 1 mM glucose.	These two findings explain the very low tyrosinase activity of cells cultured in medium with 5 mM glucose: the low activity is due to the presence of glucose and to the low pH resulting from conversion of glucose to lactic acid.	The theoretical prosecgastrin's first sequencies form the "secretin family", the tail sequencies form the "gastrin family".	The effects of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent 3-tert.-butyl-amino-1-(6'-chloro-3'-methylphenoxy)-propan-2-ol hydrochloride (bupranolol; KL 255; Betadrenol) on the plasma renin activity (PRA) of normotensive rats were studied in comparison to propranolol.	Rabbit reticulocyte incorporation of iron from rabbit transferrin was independent of transferrin iron saturation but uptake from human transferrin was saturation dependent.	Unlike human transferrin, rabbit transferrin does not surrender its iron from any unique preferred iron-binding site and can be described as functionally homogeneic.	One human transferrin iron binding site retains an ability to bind iron at somewhat acid pH but this property is not shared by rabbit transferrin.	Bovine serum albumin (BSA), Phytone, soluble starch, potato starch, spermine, lipid-extracted PPLO serum fraction, and lipid-extracted BSA could substitute for PPLO serum fraction in maintaining spiral and helical morphology at pH 7.5.	The blood pressure and circulating glycerol, acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and glucose (increased) and the heart rate and circulating insulin, lactate, pyruvate, and alanine (decreased) exhibited highly significant parabolic relationships with the steady-state plasma norepinephrine concentrations.	No change in the activity of glutaminase or gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase could be observed at concentrations up to 0.2 mM acetazolamide, and concentrations up to 1 mM were without effect on D-glutamyltransferase activity.	Blood glucose and, above all, blood insulin levels show major variations.	Similar therapy in a chemical diabetic patient caused diabetic ketoacidosis, while treatment of an insulin dependent diabetic with dexamethasone alone resulted in a major increase in her insulin requirements.	The growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL) responses to oral bromocriptine were studied in two groups of patients with Huntington's chorea and in seven healthy control subjects.	The albumin in blood plasma appears to be the main zinc binding moiety, effectively limiting zinc availability ot the red cell.	In order to check the hypothesis of an identity of dopamine (DA) and prolactin inhibiting activity (PIF), their subcellular distribution was studied in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) and the striatum, which served as a control structure.	The fraction was tested for the presence of clotting and fibrinolytic activities by application of quantitative techniques and specific substrates for measurement of prothrombin and plasminogen activation, and collagenase and elastase activity.	In basis of our experimental researches bunitrolol presented: a) beta-adrenolytic activity prevailingly at cardiac level (superior to propranolol and practolol) in respect to vascular, tracheal, bronchial, uterus, intestinal and metabolic level; b) beta-adrenergic intrinsic activity; c) local anesthetic activity; d) chinidino-like activity; e) antiarrhythmic activity; f) hypotensive activity with interferences at the level of vasomotor centres, of the barosensitive zones, of the renin secretion and of the purinergic periphery.	The nature and extent of enkephalin- and morphine-induced inhibition of pancreatic bicarbonate and protein secretion were studied in dogs with chronic pancreatic fistulae after administering exogenous secretin or octapeptide of cholecystokinin and stimulants for the endogenous release of these hormones.	The conversion of tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate was shown to be catalyzed by an aminotransferase by the following observations: the reaction was partially dependent on the presence of low concentrations of alpha-ketoglutarate; catalase was ineffective in increasing the yield of p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate; there was potent inhibition by typical inhibitors of pyridoxal phosphate enzymes and of rat liver tyrosine aminotransferase; there was no inhibition by inhibitors of L-amino acid oxidase; and there was no oxidation of L-leucine, the best substrate for rat kidney L-amino acid oxidase.	The sites of cleavage of the B-chain of oxidized insulin for proteinase 2 at pH 1.7 and pH 3.5 were shown to be similar to those previously established for human pepsin 3 and for the cathepsin E of rabbit bone marrow.	After proteolysis of ROS with papain, a fragment with molecular weight 24500 +/- 1000 was detected, which contained the same number of SH-groups and cysteine residues as in the case of intact rhodopsin.	The magnetic circular dichroism spectra (MCD) recorded for the visible and near-UV regions of high-spin ferrous derivatives of myoglobin, hemoglobin, hemoglobin dimers and isolated chains as well as of horseradish peroxidase at pH 6.8 and 11.4 have been compared at the room and liquid nitrogen temperatures.	Furthermore, the administration of haloperidol to hypophysectomized rats also significantly increased the TH activity in the ME, indicating that such changes may occur independently of any changes in serum prolactin levels.	From these results 4 conclusions were drawn: (1) following halperidol, castration, and thyroidectomy there are increases in the activity of dopaminergic terminals within the ME; (2) castration, haloperidol and thyroidectomy may influence the activity of dopaminergic terminals within the ME by different mechanisms; (3) changes in tyrosine hydroxylase and turnover of catecholamines within the ME may occur independently of changes in prolactin levels; and (4) local recurrent afferent circuits may exist in the arcuate nucleus region of the hypothalamus.	In this system the enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase is induced by glucagon, (10(-6) to 10(-8) M) hydrocortisone (10(-5) to 10(-8) M), and cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) (10(-4) to 10(-5) M).	Maintenance of the cultured hepatocytes in the presence of glucose (3g/liter) results in partial suppression of the inducing effects of glucagon and cAMP.	The specificity of the carbonic anhydrase reaction has been tested by the response elicited by gastrin acting on the parietal cells in vitro and by the use of acetazolamide.	Although thioredoxin is indispensable for the adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) sulfotransferase reaction under the usual conditions of assay in extracts of wild-type cells, the mutant grew as well as the wild type on sulfate, indicating that sulfate reduction is not rate limiting for growth.	Whereas electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form, could be transferred via thioredoxin reductase or via glutathione and glutathione reductase to reduce thioredoxin in extracts of wild-type cells, electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form, could only be transferred to the cofactor of the mutant via glutathione and glutathione reductase.	Treatment of confluent 3T3-L1 cultures with hydrocortisone (1 mug/ml) for 3 days prior to harvesting results in an increase in glutamine synthetase specific activity of 12-fold for control cultures maintained for 13 days in the absence of insulin and 1.4-fold for adipocyte cultures maintained for 13 days in the presence of insulin (10 mug/ml).	The precipitin band formed between urokinase and its antiserum is continuous with the precipitin bands formed between the seminal plasminogen activators and the urokinase antiserum.	Antisera to urokinase inhibit both the activity of urokinase and the seminal plasminogen activators.	An intermediate R430, with the 11-cis retinal as chromophore, is produced from metarhodopsin in light and is converted to rhodopsin through the processes R430 leads to P380 and P380 leads to rhodopsin.	Serum albumin and trypsin were attached to a greater extent in acidic than in alkaline media.	In patients treated with cimetidine there was a significant increase in blood gastrin levels and marked hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the antral mucosa was observed in almost all patients.	The locus of action of dopamine and dopaminergic agents such as the ergot alkaloids inhibiting prolactin secretion appears to be primarily at the pituitary level, though a hypothalamic action to increase secretion of prolactin inhibitory factor may also contribute.	The reconstituted systems required oxygen and NADPH and were not affected by the catalase which decomposes H2O2, or by 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2,2,2]octane (DABCO), which is a good quencher of singlet oxygen.	In addition, the purified enzyme had a peroxidase activity with guaiacol and potassium iodide as hydrogen donors, but not a catalase activity.	Cycloheximide treatment reduced phosphorylation of the aminotransferase only slightly and in the presence of three different inducers of this enzyme, dexamethasone, insulin, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, [32P]I incorporation was increased.	Antisera have been obtained to bovine serum albumin conjugates containing reductively aminated cellobiose, lactose, and maltose.	The changes in plasma renin activity (PRA) during short-term salt depletion (and peroral furosemide on the first day) and after bolus injection of propranolol were compared to the change during long-term treatment with diuretic and with propranolol in 19 patients with benign primary hypertension.	The activation of phosphorylase by phenylephrine and possibly also by glucagon are thought mediated by an increased concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ activating phosphorylase kinase.	The alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine has no effect on the adenylate cyclase activation by catecholamines, glucagon and histamine; the beta-adrenergic antagonist alprenolol competitively inhibits the effects of isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine, having no effect on the enzyme activation by glucagon and histamine.	There is no competition between epinephrine, glucagon and histamine for the binding site of the hormone; however, there may occur a competition between the hormone receptors for the binding to the enzyme.	The conformational transitions of calcium binding protein parvalbumin III from carp muscle were studied by scanning calorimetry, potentiometric titration and isothermal calorimetric titration.	This is followed by the presentation of the evidence that dopamine is the inhibitory hypothalamic transducer controlling hormone release by prolactin cells.	Although the dopamine concept of an inhibitory control of prolactin secretion seems quite satisfactory, the possibility of another unrelated inhibitory control system is not excluded.	Bromocriptine, a long acting dopamine agonist (a functional analogue of PIF), suppresses prolactin and is highly effective in treating many hypogonadal states since hyperprolactinaemia is common.	2 When employed at a concentration of 2 mumol/1 propranolol and atenolol significantly inhibited renin release (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01) whereas practolol and IPS 339 [t-butyl-amino-3 ol-2 propyl) oximino-9 fluorene] had little effect.	4 When practolol and IPS 339 were used in equipotent molar concentrations to propranolol for the beta1-adrenoceptors they inhibited renin release.	Only after full activation of the eluted renin was achieved with added pepsin was a distinct peak of inactive renin exposed.	Since, in the presence of glucose 11.1 mM, menadione 10 micrometer also severely decreases glucose-stimulated45 calcium net uptake and subsequent insulin release, it is concluded that the availability of reduced pyridine nucleotides may play an essential role in the secretory sequence by coupling metabolic to cationic events.	Thus, when insulinotropic nutrients are oxidized in the B-cell, the increased availability of reduced pyridine nucleotides could modify the affinity for cations of native ionophoretic systems, eventually leading to the accumulation of calcium up to a level sufficient to trigger insulin release.	The effects of hypercapnia on plasma renin concentration and blood pressure were studied in anaesthetized dogs, untreated and after pretreatment with guanethidine, propranolol or prazosin.	An increase in plasma renin concentration which accompanied hypercapnia in untreated dogs was completely suppressed by pretreatment with guanethidine or propranolol.	Radioimmunologic measurements of serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, and prolactin, carried out before treatment, at the end of treatment, and 6 months after treatment, showed a transitory increase of the LH responsiveness to GnRH in only four of the patients and in the group as a whole a slight but significant decrease of FSH responsiveness.	Exogenous or endogenous insulin combined with sodium dichloracetate reduced the hyperlactatemia and hyperpyruvicemia as well as the changes in blood pH provoked by phenformin, more strongly than did sodium dichloroacetate alone.	Myoglobin(IV), the derivative of myoglobin at the formal oxidation state IV, prepared from kangaroo (Megaleia rufa), horse, or sperm whale myoglobin, when cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature, assumes acid and alkaline forms with different optical spectra.	The acid forms of myoglobin(IV) are conveniently prepared by cooling solutions in borate buffers, initially pH 8.3, to liquid nitrogen temperature.	The study indicates that insulin administration to diabetics with high blood glucose levels may lead to transient decreases in red cell 2,3-DPG and in oxygen-releasing capacity of the red blood cells.	A combination of dexamethasone and insulin was apparently effective in stimulating the formation of a monolayer of polygonal cells with granular cytoplasm and in maintenance of liver-specific functions for relatively longer periods.	The binding of sisomicin and streptomycin to human serum albumin was studied in the absence of divalent cations by means of the dialysis method.	Hydrophobic bonds between albumin and sisomicin or streptomycin can be excluded by nuclear magnetic resonance measurements.	On the basis of the concentration dependence of the albumin binding of sisomicin and streptomycin we determined the binding affinities delta F degrees, the binding constants K1, and the maximum number n of aminoglycoside molecules that can be bound by a molecule of albumin in the absence of Ca++ ions.	Propranolol and metoprolol did not modify the peak of insulin hypoglycaemia but delayed its recovery.	Since sotalol, 1-INPEA (specific beta-adrenoceptor antagonists devoid of local anaesthetic activity); practolol and metoprolol (selective cardiac beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists) enhanced hypoglycaemic action of insulin and H 35/25 (a selective beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist) failed to affect it, it seems that selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade (similar to cardiac beta-1 adrenoceptors) mediates enhancement of insulin hypoglycaemia.	Only plasma renin activity showed a significantly greater elevation during withdrawal of the high dose of clonidine.	In contrast to true diabetic subjects, an elevated ratio of insulin to glucose during the glucose tolerance test is consistently observed indicating a peripheral insulin insensitivity.	Of these, an increase in insulin antagonistic hormones; among them growth hormone, catecholamines, and glucagon, seems to be of most significance.	Although for the individual hormones no equivocal correlation with glucose intolerance has been proved, the interaction of all of them may result in a preponderance of insulin antagonism thus leading to an apparent insulin resistance.	It is suggested that bucolome displaces bilirubin from albumin, transferring bilirubin from blood into tissues including the brain, and resulting in kernicterus.	From the distribution of methylamine, ammonia and D-lactate and the Ki for inhibition by alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate it is concluded that the matrix is more acid than the medium and that the pH of the matrix rises after glucagon treatment.	In contrast, NaN3 plus catalase, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or sodium nitroprusside activated the purified enzyme.	Sequential changes in plasma renin activity and urinary aldosterone and noradrenaline were assessed in eight patients with severe hypertension after minoxidil had been added to their treatment.	In striking contrast to normal subjects, at moderately high altitude (3,100 m) the high affinity subjects manifested: (a) lesser increments in resting heart rate; (b) minimal increases in plasma and urinary  erythropoietin; (c) no decrement in maximal oxygen consumption; and (d) no thrombocytopenia.	It has been suggested that, if dopamine antagonism is a necessary condition for the antischizophrenic action of neuroleptics, the prolactin response, as an index of dopamine blockade, would correlate with clinical response.	Morning prolactin and clinical symptomatology were measured in 15 schizophrenic patients before neuroleptic therapy, and after three and six weeks of high-dose butaperazine or loxapine treatment.	This study emphasizes the first step in the reaction for each species and includes data on the effects of p-diazobenzenesulfonic acid, albumin, benzoate, and caffeine concentrations, pH in the range from 4 to 12, and temperature.	Regression equations show good linearity between kinetically determined absorbance changes and concentration, good agreement between taken and found values for total, unconjugated, and conjugated bilirubin for synthetic samples in human serum albumin, and a good correlation between kinetic and equilibrium results for these species in sera.	The amount of insulin released into the medium and the insulin response to glucose and glucose plus theophylline were measured during the culture period.	During the first weeks, the islets cultured at pH 7.6 had a higher response to both glucose and glucose plus theophylline than islets cultured at the other pH values, but later they lost their insulin releasing ability.	The subunit structure was studied of islets-activating protein (IAP), a new protein recently isolated from the culture media of Bordetella pertussis and possessing a unique action, i.e., potentiating insulin secretory responses of animals, IAP dissociated into three subunits, F-1, F-2, and F-3, when incubated in 8M urea.	NH4+ also failed to affect the ability of theophylline and cytochalasin B to augment glucose-induced insulin release.	The metabolism of ethanol to acetaldehyde proceeds in the liver via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS), whereas catalase plays no significant role.	The mean serum glucose concentration was similar in all nutriment-infused groups, but serum insulin was significantly greater in the CHO- and P-infused as compared to the L-infused rats.	Oxidation of bivalent iron and manganese is accomplished by the simultaneous action of catalase and hydrogen peroxide produced in the respiratory chain in the course of oxidation of organic substances.	The result revealed a far-reaching potassium neutrality of diuresis-depending stimulation of renin by the beta-receptor blocker.	Alteration of the plasma glucose level by injection of insulin or glucose did not affect PEP.	The actions of the adenosine analogue on glucagon release and haemodynamics were not affected by bupranolol pretreatment.	These results indicate that the adenosine analogue mediates glucagon release by interaction with so-called adenosine receptors.	All available neuroleptics, including reserpine, raise serum prolactin levels.	Typical results obtained with insulin, catecholamines and other phenolic molecules are treated in detail.	The effect of acid pH and citrate on the exchange of iron between binding sites of rat transferrin has been studied.	In the absence of citrate, diferric transferrin shows stepwise loss of iron atoms with the first atom of iron released at approximately pH 5.2.	At pH 7.4, randomization of iron on transferrin takes from 3 to 6 h in the presence of millimolar concentrations of citrate.	We conclude that at acid pH and in the presence of citrate concentrations likely to occur in vivo in the rat there is little scrambling of iron bound to transferrin.	Among agents in the hypothalamus that can inhibit prolactin release, the most important appear to be an as yet unidentified polypeptide prolactin release inhibiting factor (PIF) and dopamine.	There is some evidence that dopamine may account for most, if not all, of the prolactin release inhibiting activity of the hypothalamus.	Acetylcholine also can inhibit prolactin release, but it appears to act via the catecholamines.	Of the agents in the hypothalamus that stimulate prolactin release, the most important appear to be an as yet uncharacterized polypeptide prolactin releasing factor (PRF), thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and serotonin.	Other agents in the hypothalamus that can stimulate prolactin release include GABA and some prostaglandins, but these have not yet been shown to be involved in physiological control of prolactin secretion.	Toxic activity was destroyed by Pronase, phospholipase, lipase, amylase, and glucosidase but not by trypsin, collagenase, cellulase, lysozyme, hyaluronidase, or neuraminidase.	None of these bands represents degradation products since a) in the solubilized samples neither acrosin, chymotrypsin, nor trypsin activities were present, b) in the presence of two protease inhibitors the same electrophoretic patterns were observed, and c) labelled globins added during sample manipulation were quantitatively recovered without degradation.	However, the less active enzyme formed by epinephrine treatment of tissues has a sedimentation constant of 30 to 35 S, whereas that of the enzyme from control tissue is 45 S. Incubation of the less active forms of the carboxylase with 10 mM citrate and up to 10 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin activated the enzyme without any change in the sedimentation constant.	Addition of free hematin, hemoglobin, methemoglobin, active or heat-inactivated catalase partially restores responsiveness of purified guanylate cyclase to MNNG, NO, nitrite, and nitroprusside.	The platelet derived mammary growth factor activity was not replaced or potentiated by thrombin or known hormones and growth factors such as prolactin, insulin, 17-beta-estradiol, progesterone, hydrocortisone, L-thyroxine, and mouse epidermal growth factor.	The response of elevated plasma renin activity during 4% and 8% CO2 inhalation was not different between the control and propranolol groups.	However, the increase of plasma renin activity in the control group was greater than that of the propranolol treated group during 12% CO2 inhalation.	Potentiometrically measured ionized calcium (Ca2+) was compared with total and albumin corrected S-Calcium and calculated Ca2+ in serum samples from blood donors and patients, for whom a request of S-Calcium has been made.	Total S-Calcium, Ca2+ and S-Albumin in donors conformed with a simple mass law equation with a mean KCaAlb = 95 l/mol, whereas apparent albumin binding affinity rose with decreasing S-Albumin in patients (due to rise of other calcium binding proteins) with resulting overestimation of albumin corrected and particularly of calculated Ca2+.	Urokinase (UK) and streptokinase (SK) transform plasminogen into plasmin by rupture of a ARG-VAL bond and the liberation of a peptide with a molecular weight of 6000 to 8000.	By contrast, streptokinase is an enzyme of bacterial origin and two hypotheses may be advanced to explain its mechanism of action: the formation of a SK-plasminogen complex capable of activatiing new molecules of plasminogen or the formation of a SK-plasminogen complex within which plasminogen is transformed to plasmin.	The plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured in 26 pregnant patients before and during ritodrine infusion (10 patients), during isoxsuprine infusion (12 patients), and during glucose infusion (4 control patients).	A low dose of ritodrine, a beta2 adrenergic agent, caused a rise of PRA but no simultaneous rise in heart rate; this suggests that beta2 activity is involved in renin release.	There was little difference in glucose and insulin levels during glucose tolerance tests in these patients, half of whom were diabetic.	Performed with a serum potassium measurement, this now reliable test is useful for primary screening and then, in conjunction with renal vein renin studies or an aldosterone profile, for diagnosis or exclusion of surgically curable renovascular or adrenocortical hypertensions.	A hypotensive effect was noted in the group of patients suffering from primary arterial hypertension with a high blood renin level and increased excretion of catecholamines in the urine.	Fasting gastrin and gastrin levels after food were not correlated to basal acid output or acid output after pentagastrin or food in any of the groups.	Blood was drawn before the intubation and 5 and 30 min after subcutaneous injection of pentagastrin, and serum group I pepsinogens (PG I) and serum gastrin were determined by radioimmunoassay methods.	Basal serum gastrin was also significantly correlated to pentagastrin-stimulated gastric pepsin output as well as to serum PG I. Pentagastrin failed to induce an increase in serum PG I during the first 30 min.	The endocrine-metabolic response to surgery, as expressed by changes in plasma ACTH, cortisol, insulin, growth hormone, cyclic adenosine-3',-5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), glucose, free fatty acids, blood b-hydroxybutyrate and cumulative nitrogen balance was measured before and during anaesthesia and surgery, and on the first five post-operative days.	However, after initiation of extracorporal circulation only ACTH, cortisol, and, to a lesser degree, the glucose and insulin response to glucose were lowered by morphine anaesthesia.	Guanylate cyclase in both the brush-border and basolateral membranes was stimulated by epinephrine, insulin, and Triton X-100, but not by carbachol.	Insulin prevented the effect of glucagon (10(-10)M) on glycogenolysis, but not that of vasopressin.	Oxygen binding studies of sperm whale myoglobin over a range of temperature and pH showed that, while the oxygen affinity was independent of pH at 25 degrees C, it increased below pH 7 at 0 degrees C and decreased below pH 7 at 37 degrees C. Hence, sperm whale myoglobin exhibits a small acid Bohr effect which most likely arises from the characterized structural changes in the deoxy proteins.	The protease inhibitors Trasylol and soyabean trypsin inhibitor prevented the activation of plasma inactive renin by acid.	'Cryoactivation' of inactive plasma renin, which occurs at -4 degrees C and alkaline pH, is also inhibited by soya-bean or lima-bean trypsin inhibitors and by the serine protease inhibitors diisopropylphosphorofluoridate and benzamidine.	Basal plasma insulin levels were low in all patients (14.8 +/- 1.0 micronU/ml in hyperosmolar coma, 11.0 +/- 1.3 in keto-acidosis), but insulin level increased after intravenous tolbutamide (between 30 and 105 micronU/ml) in eight hyperosmolar comas.	The association constants of the binding of chlorpromazine and imipramine to serum albumin at low saturation of the protein were determined by a new experimental approach with the protein concentration rather than the ligand concentration being varied.	The serum levels of immunoreactive gastrin (IRG) and secretion of gastric juice were simultaneously determined in dogs anesthetized with morphine and urethane.	These findings were discussed in relation to the mechanism of gastric juice stimulation by morphine, and it is suggested that endogenous gastrin release through the vagal and non-vagal pathways participates in morphine-induced gastric secretion.	When last studied, 31 of the 39 patients with nonfamilial hyperparathyroidism had normal serum calcium levels, 3 had permanent hypoparathyroidism, 2 had recurrent hyperparathyroidism, and 3 were lost to follow-up.	Hyperglycemic reactions can be expected following administration of diuretics (especially with long acting thiazides), diazoxide, beta-adrenergic stimulants (tocolytics), glucocorticoids, and prolactin.	Hypoglycemic reactions can occur with high doses of acetylsalicylic acid and in the presence of insulin with beta-adrenergic blockers or other inhibitors of the sympathetic system such as guanethidine.	Substances acting on gastric acid secretion (histamine, pentagastrin, atropine and metiamide) and those showing vasoactive properties (norepinephrine, epinephrine, Hypertensin, nicotinic acid and glucagon) were used.	No increase in fasting plasma levels of immunoreactive secretin and motilin was observed in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, whereas normal subjects respond to acid in the duodenum by a marked rise in the circulating levels of these hormones.	Additionally, dose-response curves of CF in response to injected norepinephrine, isoproterenol, glucagon, and calcium were depressed when compared to the normal group while the response of heart rate and blood pressure was not different.	Of four frequently used liver function tests, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and albumin, only aspartate aminotransferase was strongly affected by drinking habits.	The activity of the red blood cell enzymes transketolase, glutathione reductase, and aspartate transaminase, and their activation by the coenzymes thiamine, riboflavin, and pyridoxine, the pyruvate tolerance test, the leucocyte vitamin C concentration, and the activity in serum of gamma-glutamyl transferase were measured in a series of 35 patients with alcohol-related illness.	The incidence of thiamine deficiency was 31% as assessed by the activation of transketolase, and 55% as assessed by the pyruvate tolerance test.	The pyruvate tolerance test was found to be a more sensitive test of thiamine deficiency than the transketolase activation, and the activation of red blood cell aspartate transaminase was found to be a poor indicator of pyridoxine deficiency.	The enzyme activity was unaffected by the usual mammalian enzyme effectors glucagon, adrenaline, adenosine, GTP and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate.	NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase-catalyzed peroxidation of methyl linolenate is inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase, ethanol, and mannitol, and is potentiated by H2O2.	Human leukocyte extracts, egg white lysozyme, cationic proteins, polymyxin, colimycin, and phenol are capable of releasing lipoteichoic acids (LTA) from group A streptococci and Strep.	After two weeks of treatment a deficiency in electrolytes, low levels of prealbumin and a net increase in transferrin were noted.	The observation that catecholamines do not increase gluconeogenesis to the same extent as glucagon was not due to a differential effect on mitochondrial CO2 fixation.	Rather, catecholamines caused a smaller inhibition of pyruvate kinase activity than did glucagon.	Twenty-six serial measurements of free bilirubin concentration and apparent association constant of bilirubin for albumin (Ka) at a bilirubin: albumin molar ratio of 0.8 were performed and compared with baseline values in 11 newborn infants with acidosis before treatment and during recovery from acidosis.	The data offer in vivo evidence that correction of acidosis in the neonate results in an improvement of the apparent bilirubin binding affinity of albumin.	The CO2 transport was dependent on the rate-limiting permeation of the reacting ions, and the permeation could be increased by the influence of solutions of macromolecules such as carbonic anhydrase, albumin and dextran.	It was found that thyroliberin, melanostatin and the C-terminal tripeptide of gonadoliberin activate the dophaminergic (DA-ergic) system in the forebrain of mice treated with reserpine or haloperidol, whereas the C-terminal tripeptide of gastrin acts as a synergic blocker of the DA receptors.	In mitochondria prepared in the absence of EDTA and albumin, calcium enhanced the binding of cholesterol to cytochrome P-450 and subsequent pregnenolone synthesis.	In mitochondria prepared from adrenals homogenized in fluid containing EDTA and albumin, ACTH-induced effects on pregnenolone synthesis were relatively poor unless calcium was added to the incubation mixture.	The intravenous injection of isoprenaline (10 nmole/kg) into conscious beagle dogs caused significant increases in the blood level of lactate, glucose, FFA, insulin and cyclic AMP.	Butoxamine (10 mg/kg) antagonized isoprenaline-induced increases in glucose, lactate and insulin, but not the increases in FFA.	Salbutamol, which is known to be an agonist of the beta 2-subtype in its bronchomotor and cardiovascular actions, produced marked increases in the blood concentrations of lactate, glucose and insulin but were without effect on the FFA level.	Thus metabolic responses of conscious beagle dogs to beta-adrenoceptor agonists appeared to depend differentially on two types of beta-adrenoceptors: beta1-adrenoceptors are largely involved in lipolysis while beta2-adrenoceptors are involved in the regulation of blood glucose metabolism and insulin secretion.	A new beta-adrenoceptor agonist, 5-(1-hydroxy-2-isopropylaminobutyl)-8-hydroxycarbostyril hydrochloride hemihydrate (Procaterol), was classified as a beta 2-agonist, because it markedly increased plasma concentrations of glucose, lactate and insulin but increased the plasma level of FFA to a lesser degree.	The complex could be degraded by lysozyme, trypsin, chymotrypsin, Pronase B, and Chalaropsis sp.	Blood pressure response was independent of the pretreatment renin levels or the change in renin induced by nadolol; it was also independent of the changes in cardiac output and heart rate but was more pronounced in patients with milder baseline hypertension.	The results do not show any significant difference between the placebo and the metipranolol with respect to the blood or urinary sugar values or the plasma insulin levels.	We conclude that sickle cell patients have a defect in their ability to excrete an acute potassium load that cannot be attributed to abnormal renin or aldosterone secretion.	These babies also had lower levels of plasma transferrin but showed no differences in urea, albumin, cholesterol, and calcium levels.	The dopamine receptor blocking agent, metoclopramide, overcame the inhibitory effect of dopamine but had no effect on prolactin secretion in its absence.	The availability of established retinal cell lines with insulin receptors should facilitate the study of the insulin-retina interactions in a controlled in vitro system.	Also, in humans, intraduodenal infusion of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid releases GIP without changing serum levels of glucose or insulin.	However, such secretin injections induce a short-term insulin release and a decrease in serum glucose concentration.	Electrolytic reduction of insulin in 7 M urea of pH 8.5, followed by oxidation of the sulfhydryls in dilute solution in 7 M urea at pH 9.0 yields primarily a mixture of the monomeric, intrachain disulfides of the A-chain and of the B-chain which can be separated by chromatography on Sp-Sephadex in acidic urea.	A dose range of beta-receptor blockade was tested, and putative alpha-adrenergic effects were confirmed by combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade.beta-Adrenergic agonism (2 ng/ml isoproterenol) induced a mean integrated increase of 79+/-20% in somatostatin secretion, whereas glucagon and insulin secretion were increased by 185+/-45 and 495+/-146%, respectively.	The stimulations of D, A, and B cells were abolished by propranolol.alpha-Adrenergic agonism (10 ng/ml epinephrine) after beta-adrenergic blockade) moderately decreased somatostatin (-37+/-7%) secretion, moderately increased glucagon (91+/-19%), and markedly decreased insulin (-85+/-3%) release.	In contrast, neither the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, nor the alpha-adrenergic blocker, phentolamine, was effective in inhibiting the dopamine-induced rise in plasma glucagon (from 82+/-9 to 128+/-14 pg/ml; P < 0.005) and serum insulin (from 7.5+/-1 to 13+/-1.5 muU/ml; P < 0.005) or its suppression of plasma prolactin (from 8.5+/-1 to 5.2+/-0.8 ng/ml; P < 0.001).	Whereas some metabolic and cardiovascular effects of dopamine are mediated through adrenergic mechanisms, these observations indicate that this is not the case for the effects of this catecholamine on glucagon, insulin, and prolactin secretion, and thus provide further support for the theory of a specific dopaminergic sensitivity of these hormonal systems in man.	Cyclic AMP may regulate admission of calcium to the cell during the plateau of the action potential and promote calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum by phosphorylation of phospholamban.	Side-effects like pressor-reactions are excluded by very low priming doses (0,1 microgram/kg/min); rebound-hypertension at the end of the therapy is avoided by an overlapping therapy with renin suppressing drugs (beta-receptor blockers, clonidine, guanfacinum).	To investigate the effect of chronic alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade on renin release, plasma renin activity (PRA) was determined overnight at short intervals in 9 patients with essential hypertension before and after 7 days medication with phenoxybenzamine (20 mg orally/day).	However, the increase in renin release during phenoxybenzamine observed in patients with low PRA indicates that the responsiveness of renin secretion to stimulatory effects (most probably induced by the lowered blood pressure in our patients) remained intact during alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade.	Among the protein substrates tested, urea denaturated hemoglobin was split best, followed by gelatin, casein, field bean protein, serum albumin and gluten.	Plasma renin activity (rate of angiotensin I generation) does not increase during anesthesia with ketamine, fluroxene, halothane or enflurane in the sodium-repleted rat.	In the absence of detergents Scatchard plots are linear for human haemoglobin and soya-bean trypsin inhibitor, but non-linear for bovine serum albumin, which is also adsorbed more tightly than the other two proteins.	The introduction [corrected] of 3.5mM-sodium dodecyl sulphate causes dramatic increases in the amounts and affinities of serum albumin and haemoglobin adsorbed, but has relatively little effect on the trypsin inhibitor.	The consequences of haemodilution on small children were undesirably reduced concentrations of magnesium, calcium and albumin, and this state persisted for some days after the end of bypass.	Other tested substances including luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, thyrotropin releasing hormone, somatostatin, melanocyte stimulating hormone release inhibiting factor, beta-endorphin, neurotensin, substance P, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, angiotensin II, norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, histamine and gamma-amino butyric acid showed neither agonistic nor antagonistic effect on the release of ACTH induced by HY-CRF.	Pretreatment with propranolol significantly increased plasma RGH 120 min after insulin administration, and hypothalamic IRS decreased initially by pretreatment with propranolol, and then it increased significantly.	When pretreated with propranolol, glucagon markedly increased plasma RGH and decreased IRS significantly.	From these findings it is concluded that hypothalamic IRS may participate in the hormonal regulatory system in correlation to plasma RGH, as observed in studies on plasma GH and hypothalamic IRS following insulin, glucose, propranolol or phentolamine administration, but IRS in other regions of the brain may have some other actions as a neurotransmitter or a modulator, because of no significant correlation between plasma GH or PRL and IRS in these regions following various stimuli.	Specific examples of altered enzyme adaptations during aging include the responses of hepatic glucokinase activity to glucose and hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase activity to starvation in Sprague-Dawley rats.	Specific examples include modifications in the control of circulating levels of insulin glucagon, corticosteroids, and thyroid hormones.	Age-dependent changes in the regulation of circulating levels of insulin probably originate within the impaired ability of pancreatic islets of Langerhans to secrete the hormone in response to glucose.	Binding of human serum albumin was reduced when two chemical coupling agents, glutaraldehyde and carbodiimide were included in the human serum albumin solution, the elution of adsorbed HSA from the resins under severe flow conditions was reduced, and the amount eluted was minimal in all instances.	After peroral ingestion of 400 mg of cimetidine or placebo, simultaneous measurements of gastro-oesophageal sphincter pressure and intragastric pH were made at fixed time intervals, and at the same time blood samples were taken for determination of serum gastrin and serum cimetidine concentrations.	There was a significant direct correlation between corresponding measurements of intragastric pH and serum gastrin (p less than 0.001), between intragastric pH and serum cimetidine (p less than 0.001), and between serum gastrin and serum cimetidine (p less than 0.05).	Ingestion of cimetidine results in an increase in the serum gastrin concentration in healthy subjects, presumably as a result of reduced secretion of acid in the stomach.	Plasma potassium values are lower and plasma renin activity and plasma magnesium levels are higher in group 1 than in group 2.	Lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), basal gastric pH, and plasma levels of gastrin, estradiol, and progesterone were determined in ten women known to have normal menstrual cycles.	Postnatal changes in the pH of gastric secretions, gastric motility, serum gastrin concentration, and response of the stomach to pentagastrin administration were studied in 15 beagle puppies from birth to 5 wk of age.	The NADPH:NADP ratio as well as insulin release stimulated by glucose plus leucine were markedly decreased by methylene blue.	The thiol oxidants diamide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide also inhibited insulin secretion in response to glucose plus leucine.	From the data, we assume that the observed increase of NADPH may lead via GSH to an increase in the number of such thiol groups in the beta-cell membrane, which are believed to be related to stimulation of insulin release and, thus, to increase the sensitivity of the beta-cell to stimulation by glucose and/or leucine.	Measurements of serum epinephrine and gastrin, simultaneously, gastric mucosal blood flow and gastric secretion were carried out in cinchophen treated dogs.	No significant changes in either serum concentrations of epinephrine and gastrin or fundic mucosal microcirculation after a single 100 mg/kg cinchophen administration were found while gastric secretion increased markedly after the medication.	On the other hand, a significant increase in serum epinephrine and gastrin levels was observed while gastric secretion decreased significantly after large doses of cinchophen (300 mg/kg) were injected intravenously.	Repeated administration of 100 mg/kg cinchophen for 3 to 7 days brought about an increase in epinephrine and gastrin levels and caused an occurrence of fundic mucosal hemorrhage.	The enzyme also degraded bovine serum albumin in the presence of urea; however, several other proteins and model proteinase substrates were not cleaved.	From earlier studies it is known that bovine serum albumin has one high affinity binding site and several lower affinity sites for the sulfa drug N1-(5-ethyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)sulfanilamide (sulfaethidole) (Kostenbauder, H.B., Jawad, M.J., Perrin, J.H., and Averhart, V. (1971) J. Pharm.	To further characterize mechanisms of glucose counterregulation in man, the effects of pharmacologically inducd deficiencies of glucagon, growth hormone, and catecholamines (alone and in combination) on recovery of plasma glucose from insulin-induced hypoglycemia and attendant changes in isotopically ([3-(3)H]glucose) determined glucose fluxes were studied in 13 normal subjects.	In control studies, recovery of plasma glucose from hypoglycemia was primarily due to a compensatory increase in glucose production; the temporal relationship of glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone responses with the compensatory increase in glucose appearance was compatible with potential participation of all these hormones in acute glucose counterregulation.	Infusion of somatostatin (combined deficiency of glucagon and growth hormone) accentuated insulin-induced hypoglycemia (plasma glucose nadir: 36+/-2 ng/dl during infusion of somatostatin vs. 47+/-2 mg/dl in control studies, P < 0.01) and impaired restoration of normoglycemia (plasma glucose at min 90: 73+/-3 mg/dl at end of somatostatin infusion vs. 92+/-3 mg/dl in control studies, P<0.01).	This impaired recovery of plasma glucose was due to blunting of the compensatory increase in glucose appearance since glucose disappearance was not augmented, and was attributable to suppression of glucagon secretion rather than growth hormone secretion since these effects of somatostatin were not observed during simultaneous infusion of somatostatin and glucagon whereas infusion of growth hormone along with somatostatin did not prevent the effect of somatostatin.	The attenuated recovery of plasma glucose from hypoglycemia observed during somatostatin-induced glucagon deficiency was associated with plasma epinephrine levels twice those observed in control studies.	Infusion of phentolamine plus propranolol (combined alpha-and beta-adrenergic blockade) had no effect on plasma glucose or glucose fluxes after insulin administration.	These results indicate that in man (a) restoration of normoglycemia after insulin-induced hypoglycemia is primarily due to a compensatory increase in glucose production; (b) intact glucagon secretion, but not growth hormone secretion, is necessary for normal glucose counterregulation, and (c) adrenergic mechanisms do not normally play an essential role in this process but become critical to recovery from hypoglycemia when glucagon secretion is impaired.	The immediate and direct regulation of insulin release by circulating nutrients, especially glucose, is thought to be mediated in the pancreatic B-cell by a sequence of metabolic, ionic, and motile events.	The dose-response curves for these parameters yield a sigmoidal pattern analogous to that which depicts the rate of insulin release at increasing glucose concentrations.	For trypsin conformational changes were shown with middle points: pH 3.2; 5.8; 8.5 and for lysozyme -- pH 5.9.	A possibility for calculation of the ration between the pseudocyclic electron transport and the total electron transport based on oxygen exchange in the presence of NaN3 and catalase, was established.	Employing a modification of the in vivo model of a liquid-filled canine lung, we measured the movement of substances of specific sizes (albumin, 69,000 daltons with a molecular radius of 35 A; and dextran with a molecular weight of 150,000 to 170,000 and an approximate molecular radius of 100 A) from the pulmonary capillary blood to the liquid-filled lung.	For both albumin and dextran with a molecular weight of 150,000 to 170,000, the time for 50 percent equilibration between the specific substance in the blood and the same substance in the pulmonary liquid decreased significantly with instillation of pulmonary liquid with a pH of 1.5 and 2.5 but did not with a pH of 3.5 or above (P less than 0.05).	Hormones such as glucocorticoids, catecholamines and glucagon can stimulate enzyme induction during development; on the other hand, insulin has been shown to antagonize these stimulatory effects.	The most significant drugs as regards driving risk are obviously certain antianxiety agents, hypnotics, stimulants, hallucinogens, marihuana, lithium and narcotic analgesics, as well as ganglionic blocking agents, insulin and sulphonylurea derivates.	During bromocriptine treatment, 2.5 mg twice daily, ovulation took place earlier and luteal phase became longer irrespective of the basal serum prolactin level.	Our results show that bromocriptine may be effective even when no apparent indication for prolactin suppression can be demonstrated.	Renal prostaglandins (PG) appear to mediate renin release due to stimulation of the intrarenal baroreceptor, but not that due to activation of the macula densa.	Indomethacin (5 mg/kg) suppressed urinary PGE(2) and PGF(2alpha) excretion by 89 and 74%, respectively, arachidonate hypotension by 82%, and inhibited the elevated renin levels from hydralazine by 100% without altering the hypotensive effect of the drug.	H133/22-induced renin release was inhibited by 80% by indomethacin pretreatment.	By method of isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel and sucrose density gradient it has been shown that rhodopsin preparation, obtained by different methods (including the rhodopsin with low content of lipids) are divided into a number of fractions with isoelectric points at the pH-range 5.4-6.0.	That the distribution of transferrin is limited to the materno-foetal interface supports the hypothesis that binding of maternal transferrin to trophoblast receptors is involved in the process of iron transport to the foetus.	These findings suggest that transferrin receptors may play important biological roles in addition to that of iron transport from mother to foetus.	Since successful pancreatic islet transplants have been shown to lower basal hepatic glucose output, gluconeogenesis, and urea production, pancreatic islet transplants seemed to be a more physiological model to test the in vivo effects of insulin on guanylate cyclase activity in diabetic animals.	Plasma secretin, plasma gastrin and pancreatic bicarbonate output were measured in three healthy youths before and after a 10 min period of duodenal infusion of 50, 75 and 100 ml 100 mmol/1 HCl.	Plasma secretin rose to a shortlived peak within 10 min, whereas plasma gastrin fell gradually to values significantly below the basal level 60 min after the start of duodenal acidification.	No significant correlation was found between plasma secretin and plasma gastrin.	It is suggested that the pancreatic stimulation subsequent to duodenal acidification is mainly effected by release of secretin, and that the fall in plasma gastrin may be caused by a HCl-induced inhibition of gastrin release from the duodenum.	Oxidative phosphorylation of isolated canine myocardial mitochondria has been evaluated after exposure to different concentrations of phosphate (5--50 mM), lactate ion in excess (5--40 mM, pH 7.4), calcium (50--270 nmol/mg protein), to lactic acidosis (pH 6.3), and to mitochondrial protein dilution (in vitro volume expansion) for 10 min to 8 h. The influence of phosphate and lactate ion addition, lactic acidosis, and in vitro volume expansion on mitochondrial function were studied in the isolation medium (0.18 M KCl, 0.5% BSA (bovine serum albumin), with or without Tris-EDTA, pH 7.4) prior to evaluation of mitochondrial function in the assay medium (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, and 10 mM inorganic phosphate, pH 7.4).	In the two groups of patients the antihypertensive effectiveness of both short-term intravenous or chronically oral propranolol was directly related to the extent to which the drug produced an absolute reduction in plasma renin activity (PRA).	Data on the role of the position of the oxyhemoglobin equilibrium curve in the regulation of erythropoiesis during the "anemia of prematurity" demonstrate that the ability to unload oxygen is more important than the absolute hemoglobin level in both the stimulus to erythropoietin production and the clinical manifestations of anemia.	The reaction is inhibited by hemoglobin and catalase, whose presence in unwashed microsomes could terminate the N-oxidation of phentermine at the hydroxylamine level.	The effect of labetalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking antihypertensive, on plasma renin activity (PRA) and the hemodynamics of healthy volunteers at rest and during an ergometric exercise test was studied.	In renin release the vasodilating alpha-blockade thus dominated the beta-blocking property of labetalol at the dose which decreased the blood pressure.	There were no significant differences in the changes in total calcium, albumin or hydrogen ion concentration during dialysis between each group.	Treatment with beta-blockers, alone or in association with diuretics, controlled blood pressure in 90% of cases, regardless of the renin activity.	Human plasminogen isolated from the placenta serum fraction by means of affinity chromatography was activated by trypsin being in covalent bond with sepharose.	Utilization of the immobilized trypsin as a plasminogen activator makes it possible to transform completely the proenzyme to plasmin varying the plasminogen-trypsin ratio and time of activation when it is conducted under optimal conditions: in the presence of 25% glycerol at pH 7.0-7.1 and the temperature of 30 degrees C.	The increased tolerance to ganglioplegics was not correlated with the elevation of the blood sugar level, and proved to be resistant to an acute administration of insulin.	Other tested substances including luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, thyrotropin releasing hormone, melanocyte stimulating hormone release inhibiting factor, somatostatin, substance P, neurotensin, beta-endorphin.	In this study the oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) including the determination of immunologically measurable insulin (IMI) has been performed in 49 lithium-treated out-patients, and in 125 inpatients under neuroleptic long-term treatment.	Human amniotic renin was activated by dialysis against acidic buffer (pH 3.3), direct acidification or trypsin treatment.	Unlike that of serum of urine lysozyme and serum copper, the determination of urine arylsulfatase activities appears to be a consistent, useful indicator of response to antileukemic therapy.	After such a change, free calcium (1.7 +/- 0.4%), total calcium (4.6 +/- 0.7%), total protein (11.5 +/- 1.4%), albumin (12.2 +/- 2.0%), total magnesium (3.8 +/- 0.9%), and the activity of hydrogen ion (2.9 +/- 1.0%) decreased significantly (values are means +/- SEM), but promptly reverted when three subjects assumed the alternative posture.	The effect of metabolic acidosis simulated in vitro on ammoniagenesis was investigated by using the isolated kidney of the rat perfused with an albumin Krebs-Henseleit medium containing glutamine and glucose.	Bovine serum albumin protected the tetrodotoxin binding activity of the membrane from the inhibitory effect of phospholipase A2 but not from that of phospholipase C. In the presence of albumin about 25% of the membrane phospholipids remained unhydrolyzed by phospholipase A2.	Blood pressure, heart rate, plasma renin activity, plasma norepinephrine and plasma epinephrine were determined in 11 patients with essential hypertension at rest before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after an intravenous infusion of 0.12 mg./Kg.	Plasma renin activity decreased progressively by 48 per cent 60 minutes after propranolol, whereas plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine were always higher after propranolol than control values.	This augmented sympathetic activity might explain why propranolol, when acutely infused, does not decrease blood pressure despite effective cardiac and renin blockade.	Enzymes of the first group, comprising lactase, maltase, sucrase, leucine aminopeptidase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, all yielded a single slope on the Arrhenius plot in the range 10--40 degrees C and did not appear to experience functionally the effects of the lipid thermotropic transition.	The hormones tested were insulin, thyroxine and prednisolone.	Prednisolone alone resulted in a two-fold increase in tyrosine amino-transferase activity in explanted liver in hormone-free medium on day 6, and its effect was dose dependent, but neither insulin nor thyroxine alone induced the enzyme.	Addition of prednisolone plus thyroxine and prednisolone plus insulin increased the enzyme activity 1.4- and 1.3-fold, respectively, over that of explants with prednisolone alone.	These three hormones together had the greatest effect, causing induction of 1.5-fold more activity than that with prednisolone plus insulin or plus thyroxine.	The three hormones were not all needed continuously during the culture period: prednisolone and insulin were required during the early part of cultivation and thyroxine during the later part.	Phase-contrast microscopy showed that prednisolone stimulated liver epithelial cell outgrowth, probably acting with insulin.	A mixture of glycosidases from the liver of the gastropod Turbo cornutus was co-immobilized with bovine serum albumin and glutaraldehyde, and then cast as membranes.	The recovery of N-acetyl-beta-D-hexosaminidase after immobilization was unaffected by increasing the concentration of glutaraldehyde, but was decreased by increasing the bovine serum albumin concentration.	Of the different systems tested barbital buffer containing 0.1% human serum albumin proved to be the best, preferably in the presence of bovine gamma-globulin.	Adrenaline was more effective than noradrenaline in reducing oedema produced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) and histamine and by agents which release these amines (compound 48/80, dextran and antigen challenge with egg albumin in sensitized rats), but noradrenaline was more potent against bradykinin-induced oedema.	HTC cell variants chosen for their lack of tyrosine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.5) (TAT) induction by glucocorticoids were tested for interrelated effects on other glucocorticoid responses: TAT induction by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dBcAMP) +/- dexamethasone, glutamine synthetase (GS) induction, cyclic nucleotide phosphodieterase (PDE) suppression, inhibition of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) uptake, inhibition of plasminogen activator (PA), and induction of mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV).	The induction and maintenance of elevated levels of tyrosine aminotransferase activity in liver cells were completely dependent upon the presence of both the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, and glucagon of dibutyryl cyclic AMP.	Immunotitration experiments revealed that the 6- to 7-fold increase in tyrosine aminotransferase activity following the addition of dexamethasone and glucagon was accompanied by a parallel increase in the amount of immunologically reactive enzyme protein.	HTC cells, an established line of rat hepatoma cells in tissue culture, provide a useful experimental model system for studying the interaction of glucocorticoids and insulin in the regulation of protein metabolism.	The actions of insulin and glucocorticoids on amino acid transport and protein degradation are antagonistic in this cell line.	The addition of insulin to HTC cells previously incubated with dexamethasone causes a rapid further doubling in the cellular concentration of this enzyme.	The properties of the induction by insulin differ in several respects from the induction by glucocorticoids.	The transcapillary escape rate of albumin was measured in 27 consecutive patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases before and after 1 and 7 days of prednisone treatment in doses of 45 mg/day.	Superoxide dismutase, catalase, dimethyl sulphoxide, benzoate, and mannitol counteracted the effects of alloxan in both cytotoxicity assays.	At pH 3.8, bovine serum albumin and histone give the greatest stimulation, while protamine sulfate, spermine, spermidine and hyamine 2389 stimulate to a lesser extent.	Since protein in the enzyme preparation substitutes for exogenous stimulator to a varying degree, serum albumin should be included in the assay mixture for sperm and testicular hyaluronidase to assure measurement of maximum enzyme activity.	A fully carbamylated derivative of plasminogen having no free amino groups has been prepared and converted by urokinase to an active enzyme, called carbamyl plasmin A, with a single free NH2-terminal amino group (Val-561).	Diminished prolactin secretion and the dissociation of response to TRH and chlorpromazine were shown.	Two-hour oral glucose tolerance tests were performed at 6-month intervals during the study; serum insulin was determined at the same intervals in half the women.	After 6 months the fasting glucose of women using oral contraceptives was significantly decreased; at 120 minutes, glucose and insulin levels were significantly increased in comparison to women using mechanical contraceptives.	methemoglobin, bovine serum albumin, or sucrose.	The addition of dithiothreitol, methemoglobin, bovine serum albumin, or sucrose to enzyme markedly broadens the dose-response curve for nitric oxide.	The standard perfusion medium was Krebs-Henseleit-NaHCO3 buffer containing glucose, dextran, albumin, propranolol, and dexamethasone.	It could be resolved into apoenzyme and thiamine pyrophosphate in an acidic medium, in contrast to baker's or brewer's yeast transketolase which resolved in an alkaline solution.	All the activity of pig liver transketolase was lost upon incubation at pH 5.0 for two hours even at 0 degrees C but about 40% of the original activity could be restored by the addition of excess thiamine pyrophosphate and CaCl2.	Potentiation of the diabetogenic effect by phentolamine is not related to alpha-adrenoceptor block, vasodilatation or insulin release.	These results confirm the previously reported finding that 5-HT-induced increase in blood glucose is mediated via adrenaline released from adrenal medulla by 5-HT and suggest that the increase in plasma cAMP, induced by 5-HT, is due to glucagon released by an unknown factor, or factors other than adrenaline released from the adrenal medulla by 5-HT.	There was, however, no correlation between ionized calcium and albumin.	Antisera were raised in rabbits by immunization with nortriptyline conjugated to succinylated ovine albumin.	Inactive renin can also be activated by exposure of plasma to exogenous trypsin, and in normal plasma the quantities of inactive renin that are activated after acidification and with trypsin are identical.	Prekallikrein (Fletcher factor)-deficient plasma, however, has much lower renin activity after acidification than with trypsin.	Thus acid activation of inactive renin depends on plasma prekallikrein, whereas the action of trypsin is independent of prekallikrein.	The following evidence indicates that the rebound increase in blood pressure was due to increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system: (1) plasma renin activity was increased approximately four-fold by SNP, (2) rebound did not occur in nephrectomized rats, (3) rebound was markedly attenuated in animals treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, SQ14225, (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline) and (4) beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol reduced the rebound response.	Concentrations of noradrenaline, adrenaline and methoxamine of 10(-6), 10(-5), 10(-4) and 10(-3) M caused significant dose-related inhibition of renin release.	In contrast, phenylephrine, oxymetazoline and clonidine did not inhibit renin release.	Various fractions derived at each step were tested for the presence of substances which stimulate or inhibit prolactin secretion in vitro and in vivo.	The concentration of the fractions of corticosteroids, aldosterone, catecholamines, and cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP) in blood of the adrenal veins and the activity of renin in blood of the renal veins were studied in 22 patients with stages IIA and IIB hypertensive disease.	The use of high doses of neuroleptics, atropine and insulin comas in these cases were ineffective.	These drugs also had the same order of potency in inducing catalepsy and increasing dopamine turnover and prolactin release.	We report here that phosphatidylserine from bovine brain is a relatively specific activator of human brain galactosylceramidase in the absence of sodium taurocholate (phosphatidylserine system).	The assays of galactosylceramidase with phosphatidylserine and without taurocholate do not necessarily provide pragmatic advantages but offer a potentially useful system with which to study the mechanism of in vivo degradation of the membrane-bound glycosphingolipid.	Different rates of iron release were obtained with the different proteins, greatest with human transferrin and least with lactoferrin.	It is concluded that iron release from transferrin under the conditions of these experiments involves an initial interaction between H+ and the iron-transferrin complex followed by release of the iron under the action of the mediator.	2,4-Diisopropyldeuteroheme-myoglobin showed a four times lower oxygen affinity at 25 degrees C and larger enthalpy and entropy changes of oxygenation than the corresponding values of native myoglobin.	This decrease of bilirubin was returned to preinjection level after intravenous injection of albumin.	In in vitro study, bucolome displaced bilirubin from human albumin strongly.	From these results, a strong action to displace bilirubin from plasma albumin is concluded as the mechanism of bucolome to decrease plasma bilirubin.	Particulate fractions of myocardium taken from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) contained an adenylate cyclase system that was less responsive than normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats to norepinephrine, isoproterenol (mixed beta-agonist), salbutamol (beta 2-agonist), dobutamine (beta 1-agonist), dopamine, histamine, and glucagon.	The present study was conducted to determine the effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation on plasma glucose and glucagon (IRG) levels in Japanese quail.	Blood glucose concentrations after insulin did not decrease below the fasting level of non-diabetic animals and none of the rabbits had signs of hypoglycermia.	The stimulatory effect of insulin on heart rate was not influenced by autonomic nervous blockade by propranolol or by propranolol plus atropine.	injection of glucose and ATP on insulin changes in external jugular vein was determined in normal and alloxan diabetic animals.	In alloxan diabetic rats, despite the high blood glucose levels, the plasma insulin was low and did not respond to glucose stimulation.	The insulin stimulatory effect normally produced by glucose is through purinergic nerves.	The loaded cellulose is given into a column and the haptoglobin eluted by a 0.1 M to 0.15 M acetate buffer.	NH4+ and menadione, agents that promote a more oxidized state in islet NADP, did not affect islet ATP content or the rates of [U-14C]4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate oxidation or amination, but markedly inhibited islet 45Ca uptake and insulin release.	The pancreata perfused at pH 7.4 exhibited a biphasic insulin response to glucose challenge together with signs of increased emiocytotic activity and numerous microtubules in the beta cells.	The results are presented of the urinary concentrating ability after water deprivation and the intranasal administration of vasopressin, of the simultaneous determination of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), of the minimal urine pH after an oral dose of ammonium chloride, and of the urinary beta-2-microglobulin excretion.	The effects of acute and repeated administration of pyridoxine on serum prolactin levels were studied in 18 chronic schizophrenics, 10 women and 8 men, in whom hyperprolactinemia had been induced by long-term treatment with phenothiazines, haloperidol, sulpiride or clopentixol.	It was not volatile or susceptible to proteolytic enzymes, lysozyme, lipase, DNAase, RNAase or certain chelating agents.	The method utilized lactoperoxidase, potassium iodide, and a glucose--glucose oxidase system for the generation of hydrogen peroxide and l-tyrosine.	This study evaluated with dopamine antagonists the possibility that such dopamine hypersensitivity extends to the tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) system, which regulates, by inhibition, pituitary prolactin secretion.	Plasma prolactin concentrations in six patients with tardive dyskinesia were assessed in four conditions: During chronic haloperidol therapy; serially after abrupt haloperidol withdrawal; while unmediated; and in response to an acute dose of 0.5 mg IM haloperidol.	Blood was drawn before, every 30 min throughout the infusion, and the next morning for determination of serum group I pepsinogens (PG I), serum gastrin, and plasma secretin.	Plasma secretin was not affected by gastric suction or by prolonged infusion of pentagastrin, whereas serum gastrin fell during secretion infusion accompanied by gastric suction.	These findings indicate that Desferal and transferrin deprive T. mentagrophytes of nutritional iron and thus inhibit growth of the fungus.	To examine the mechanism of the recently reported effect of an acidified intragastric test meal on insulin release and glucose homeostasis, a liver extract test meal at either pH 2 or pH 7 was instilled into the stomach of normal dogs and dogs with a chemical sympathectomy or indomethacin-induced prostaglandin deficiency, all of which had a bisected pylorus and gastric fistula.	In the normal dogs the instillation of the liver meal at pH 2 elicited a significant rise in plasma glucose, glucagon and insulin levels, while in response to the meal at pH 7 only glucagon rose significantly.	There were no significant changes in the plasma levels of cyclic AMP, insulin, glucose, free fatty acids, 3-hydroxy-butyrate or glycerol.	These findings give support to the assumption that the binding site for warfarin on the albumin molecule is affected by the neutral-to-base transition in the protein.	In an attempt to identify the sites at which cimetidine stimulates prolactin release, the drug was administered intravenously (6 mg/kg body weight) to healthy subjects under basal conditions, during dopamine infusion (1 microgram/Kg-min for 120 min) and after pretreatment with L-dopa plus carbidopa (250 plus 25 mg every 6 for 1 day).	The serum prolactin response to cimetidine was abolished by dopamine infusion and almost completely suppressed by L-dopa plus carbidopa administration.	The stoichiometry of bilirubin--albumin interaction has been analyzed and quantitated in several recent studies, confirming that albumin binding of bilirubin obeys the law of mass action [4, 5, 14, 16, 26, 36, 43, 46, 61, 65, 73, 92, 111].	In this report, we propose a model of the pathogenesis of kernicterus which views serum albumin and tissue as competing with each other for binding the miscible bilirubin pool.	Evidence is presented to show that bilirubin normally binds reversibly to cellular membranes and certain soluble enzymes just as it does to albumin; the unbound bilirubin concentration is the driving force for both albumin and tissue binding.	We propose that albumin binding is determined by the concentration of free bilirubin anion (which is essentially unaffected by physiologic pH changes), and that tissue binding is mainly determined by the concentration of free bilirubin acid (which is greatly influenced by pH).	In developing this argument, we will sequentially discuss relevant features of bilirubin chemistry, the binding of bilirubin to albumin, the formation of bilirubin--tissue complexes, bilirubin toxicity, alternative viewpoints of bilirubin transport, and, finally, the implications of this model to the clinical management of jaundiced infants.	A mult-channel system for continuous bedside monitoring of glucose, pH pCO2 and automatic computer-controlled infusion of insulin, glucose, potassium, and bicarbonate solutions is described.	Since phosphate buffer also releases gastrin, the releasing effect ought to be exerted beyond the mechanism that can be blocked by somatostatin.	This could be reduced by bromocriptine, and the possible role of prolactin in the behavioural disorders present is discussed.	We demonstrated that plaminogen is present in acid-treated plasma in sufficient quantity to convert prorenin into renin after activation by streptokinase.	Body weight, serum electrolytes, blood gases, pH and base excess in the arterial blood, urea-nitrogen, hemoglobin and albumin content of the blood did not change significantly.	The effects of the antipsychotic/antidepressant drug CI-686 on apomorphine- and amphetamine-induced stereotypies, dopamine metabolism, neuroleptic binding, and serum prolactin levels were determined.	A lethal synergism between morphine and tropolone, an inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase, was previously noted in adult male Holtzman rats.	The cleavage of the B-chain of oxidized insulin by enzyme was studied and compared with the digestion of the same substrate by chicken and pig pepsin.	The perfused stomach in the anaesthetized rat was used to investigate the action of somatostatin on the gastric acid secretion stimulated by gastrin, histamine and carbamylcholine.	Treatment with either mepyramine or metiamide significantly reduced the extravasation of albumin and rate of oedema formation.	The association of 19+ with leukocytes and subsequent release of lysozyme could be blocked by alpha-methyl-D-mannoside but not by equivalent concentrations of dextrose and sucrose.	The partition of bilirubin in vitro between water and isobutyl-methylketone/n-heptane mictures is investigated at different pH, in the absence and the presence of albumin.	Results are used to compute the concentrations of unbound ionized and unionized bilirubin and the bilirubin-albumin characteristics (association constant K and nomber n of primary binding sites per mole of albumin).	1 mg/kg: reduction of serum prolactin level, c. 5 mg/kg: potentiation of L-5 HTP, d. 10 mg/kg: antagonism of the effects of reserpine and of tetrabenazine, e. increased activity and social behaviour, EEG alerting effect limited to 1 hour and increase in paradoxical sleep (15 to 20 mg/kg).	The effects of neurotensin on insulin and somatostatin release were examined in isolated pancreatic islets prepared from 3-4 days rats, and maintained in culture for 48 h before use.	In the presence of 12 mM glucose, glucagon (50-2,000 ng/ml, i.e.	14-560 nM) caused a 2-fold increase in insulin and somatostatin release.	Neurotensin (150 ng/ml, i.e., 100 nM) did not affect the glucagon-stimulated release, nor did it alter the release of either peptide measured at 12 mM glucose in the absence of glucagon.	In contrast, neurotension markedly inhibited the release of both insulin and somatostatin that was induced by 23 mM glucose.	These observations suggest that neurotensin may modulate the release of insulin and somatostatin evoked by high glucose concentrations, but not that resulting from the action of glucagon on pancreatic islets.	Plasma phosphorus displayed a highly significant (p less than 0.001) fall with a maximum depression below baseline of 1.11 +/- 0.15 mg/100 ml or 33 +/- 3% (mean +/- SEM); there was a significant correlation (p less than 0.01) between this fall and the insulin peaks induced by arginine.	In six normal subjects, the test was repeated with the addition of somatostatin (250 micrograms bolus, followed by 500 micrograms/hr), which abolished the insulin and growth hormone response to arginine.	These findings show that arginine is responsible for a fall in plasma phosphorus related to the insulin response, and for an increase in plasma potassium of clinical significance, the mechanism(s) of which, however, are still obscure.	beta-adrenergic blocking drugs were then given to suppress renin secretion and diuretics restarted.	This study was aimed at evaluating the effect of theophylline, a drug that increases the intracellular concentrations of cAMP by inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity, on somatostatin (SRIF)-mediated inhibition of insulin secretion in man.	In some of these students, serum FSH, LH, prolactin, estradiol, and progesterone were assayed every day or every other day throughout the second cycle after entry.	In the present study, six male and four female psychiatric inpatients, who had not received neuroleptic medication for at least 1 week before the study began, received an injection of chlorpromazine (CPZ) 25 mg im; serum prolactin levels were monitored for 6 hours after injection.	Although insulin stimulation of glucose uptake into fat cells was highest at pH 7.5, this response was also seen at pH 8.6.	Studies were carried out before and during acute blockade of renin release by propranolol, ACTH suppression by dexamethasone and combined renin and ACTH blockade.	In contrast, when the renin response to tilt was acutely suppressed by propranolol administration, the aldosterone response was nonetheless maintained but now appeared to be under ACTH control, since concurrent increases in cortisol were observed.	In normal subjects somatostatin cannot modify the plasma levels of prolactin when they are in a normal range or when they are pharmacologically increased.	In the case of pituitary adenoma (prolactinic or eosinophilic), the response of prolactin to somatostatin varies widely.	The obtained results can be summarized as follows: 1) existence of putative receptors for various hormones (estradiol, testosterone, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, progesterone, prolactin) in the mammalian pineal gland; (2) steroid metabolic pattern in the pineal gland resembling other brain areas involved in gonadotrophic regulation; (3) control of pineal estrophilic and androphilic receptors by adrenergic transmitter through beta-adrenergic receptors and at a translational level; (4) denervation supersensitivity of hormone receptors to neurotransmitter; (5) modification of neuronal activity by hormone treatment at ganglionic and preganglionic sites of action; (6) estrophilic binding sites in ganglia; (7) correlation of pineal responsiveness to hormones with activity of sympathetic nerves; (8) modification by hormones of pineal beta-adrenergic mechanisms; (9) dissociation of hormone effects on the pineal gland in those mediated or modulated by changes in afferent neuronal activity and those relatively unaffected by denervation.	The rise and subsequent return to basal of glucose production (Ra) during a constant glucagon infusion ("downregulation") has suggested to some workers that glucagon's effects are evanescent.	To examine whether glucagon displays persistent biological activity even after downregulation, 6 healthy males received an 8 hour infusion of somatostatin and glucagon, with 3H-3-glucose to measure glucose turnover.	Six additional subjects received an 8 hour somatostatin infusion, with glucagon administered concomitantly for the first 5 hours.	The clinical effectiveness of published algorithms in correcting serum total calcium (CaT) for the effects of protein, albumin, and pH was tested.	The activity of the lipogenic enzymes of catfish liver was always low, regardless of the proportions of lipids or carbohydrates in the diet and could not be raised by insulin administration.	Experience with 17 patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is presented with special reference to stimulation tests (secretin, glucagon, calcium infusion, test meal) and to localization and immunohistologic, ultrastructural, and biochemical findings in gastrinomas.	Trypsin, phospholipase C, and lysozyme do not produce any changes of the glycocalyx, while hyaluronidase and neuraminidase lead to partial and subcomplete removal respectively.	The model  proposes a mechanism whereby glucose may trigger first-phase insulin secretion; reinforcing mechanisms, such as raised levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, could augment subsequent secretion.	The calcium ion might act as the missing second messenger for insulin action.	The mediators were defined in terms of their physicochemical characteristics: slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) by purification through silicic acid chromatography and inactivation by arylsulfatase; eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A) by its gel filtration through Sephadex G-25 and inactivation by subtilisin and not trypsin; and platelet-activating factor (PAF) by its inherent binding to albumin.	These facts are compatible with a bihormonal-abnormality hypothesis, which holds that the major consequence of absolute or relative insulin lack is glucose underutilisation and that absolute or relative glucagon excess is the principal factor in the over-production of glucose in diabetes.	Multiple deficiency states were found--including iron, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin C, calcium and vitamin D, serum proteins and albumin, water, and potassium.	Hourly blood samples during a 24 hour period revealed a direct correlation between plasma glucose and glucagon.	The oral administration of glucose paradoxically increased whereas the intravenous administration decreased plasma glucagon.	Circulating glucagon levels were markedly increased with arginine and epinephrine infusion.	Both short- and long-term administration of alpha adrenergic blockade depressed the glucagon response to epinephrine infusion.	In contrast, long-term alpha adrenergic blockade increased glucagon secretion despite improved glucose tolerance during a second 24 hour study.	We conclude that (1) the tumor was responsive to physiologic stimuli known to affect glucagon secretion; (2) elevations of plasma glucagon levels with oral and dietary glucose suggest regulation of secretion by intestinal factors; and (3) improvement of glucose tolerance with alpha adrenergic blockade may be related to increased insulin secretion.	By measurements of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatases, gamma globulin, prothrombin time, bilirubin, and albumin, half of the medical patients were correctly classified into one of seven diagnostic categories.	), prolactin, oestrogen, and progesterone were measured in all.	Erythropoietin-responsive stem cell (ERC) kinetics in anephric uremic rabbits were studied in vitro using the growth of erythroid colonies in a methyl cellulose system in cultures with and without the addition of erythropoietin (ESF).	The effects of testosterone and erythropoietin (ESF) on erythroid colony formation in normal human  bone marrow cultures were studied in vitro using a methyl cellulose gel system.	The interaction of (N-methyl-14C) morphine with purified human albumin and gamma globulin and with human plasma was studied by equilibrium dialysis.	The thyroxine binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine binding prealbumin (TBPA), albumin, thyroxine (T(4)) and the triiodothyronine uptake test (T(3)-test) values have been estimated in serum of twenty patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease.	In two studies heparin had no consistent effect on plasma renin activity.	Quantitative analysis of similar samples by cellulose acetate electrophoresis gave the following ratios of protein concentration in gastric lymph to plasma: total protein, 0.51; albumin, 0.68; total globulins, 0.42; alpha1-globulin, 0.49; alpha2-globulin, 0.62; beta-globulin, 0.35; fibrinogen, 0.39; and gamma-globulin, 0.46.	The results of these studies indicated that breast cancer patients had glucose intolerance and delayed and prolonged insulin secretion, increased basal growth hormone levels and insensitivity of adipose tissue to growth hormone.	Laser Raman spectroscopy has been used to probe specific molecular interactions inside two models of transport membrane proteins, valinomycin and gramicidin A. Conformational changes of these molecules, as well as specific interactions with ions, can be detected and may help elucidate how membrane transport proteins such as Na+ minus K+ ATPase and rhodopsin function.	Lysosomal enzymes, catalase, 6-phospho-gluconic acid and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase were uniformly distributed.	The abnormalities in blood sugar and plasma insulin responses to oral glucose arising during induction of diabetes are presented.	Allergic histamine release from leukocytes was compared in three different media: Tyrode physiologic saline solution, Tris-buffered saline containing human albumin, calcium, and magnesium (Tris-ACM), and Tris-ACM with homologous serum.	for duodenal-ulcer patients in relapse was significantly greater than the ratios for the patients in remission and for the normal group (P less than 0-001), suggesting either the presence of an increased sensitivity to insulin stimulation or a lack of pepsin inhibitor substance during a relapse of ulcer symptoms.	Eight received insulin alone, and eight, including two of the original insulin-only group, were given propranolol and insulin.	plasma sugar and insulin levels were measured in 118 newly diagnosed maturity-onset diabetic patients before and after treatment with diet alone for periods of 2 and 6 months.	Methods were developed for the coupling of biotin to bovine serum albumin and bovine gamma-globulin using a water-soluble carbodimide.	The use of [14-C]biotin as a tracer allowed quantitation of the incorporation of biotin into the conjugates: 2.55 mol of biotin was incorporated per mol of gamma-globulin and 7-9 mol of biotin was incorporated per mol of serum albumin in different preparations.	Granulocytes from the peripheral blood of normal subjects and a patient with hereditary myeloperoxidase deficiency were homogenized in 0.34 M sucrose.	Rabbit antisera against IM3 or IM6 coupled to bovine serum albumin also appear to contain antibodies with nonterminal specificity for dextran chains although a large fraction has terminal specificity.	While the blood-sugar concentrations were similiar in the two groups the absolute insulin increment and the relative insulin response to a 50 g. oral glucose load were significantly lower in those with retinopathy than in those without.	In comparison with the healthy, renin activity was increased in patients with thyrotoxicosis and displayed a positive correlation with the severity of the disease the level of protein-bound iodine, tachycardia and the degree of loss of weight.	Depletion of albumin in newborn pig plasma did not appreciably affect the binding of pentobarbital.	It apparently does not exist at birth in the plasmas of the other species studied, as depletion of albumin markedly reduced the fractional binding of pentobarbital.	32P, 131I-labeleed human serum albumin, 75Se-seleno-methionine, 107Hg-chlormerodrin, 67Ga-citrate and labelled bleomycin compounds, among others are discussed with particular respect to their observed clinical characteristics and suggested mechanisms of uptake.	Changes in iv glucose tolerance (IVGTT) and serum insulin responses to glucose infusion have been measured in intact female rhesus monkeys treated per os with norethindrone or medroxyprogesterone acetate (500 mug/day) both alone and in combination with mestranol or ethinyl estradiol (10 mug/day) orally for 3 weeks.	When administered as the sole contraceptive steroid, neither norethindrone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, mestranol, or ethinyl estradiol produced consistent changes in fasting serum insulin or glucose concentration, mean intravenous serum glucose disappearance rates (K) or mean integrated serum insulin response to glucose (sigmal40).	By contrast, concurrent administration of norethindrone with mestranol or ethinyl estradiol resulted in a significant increase in the fasting serum insulin concentration and the mean sigmal40.	We have measured plasma estrone, prolactin, estrogen-stimulated neuorphysin, and sex steroid-binding globulin concentrations in 50 men with chronic alcoholism and varying degrees of alcoholic liver disease in an effort to further elucidate possible hormonal mechanisms responsible for the observed feminization.	The plasma concentrations of estrone and prolactin in men studied with synecomastia were significantly greater (p smaller than or equal to 0.01 and p smaller than or equal to 0.05, respectively) than were the concentrations of these two hormones in those without this physical sign.	On a model of experimental pneumonia in mice caused by the L-forms of bacteria against the background of diminished immunity a study was made of the therapeutic efficacy of penicillin, lincomycin, lysozyme and gamma-globulin.	These changes included a marked decrease in the total proteins and the albumin fraction, together with a significant elevation in levels of alkaline phosphatase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase, bilirubin, and creatinine.	The properties of human benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and rat prostate were compared after culture in the absence of insulin and testosterone.	Bleomycin has been radioiodinated by the iodine monochloride, chloramine-T, and lactoperoxidase methods.	However it differs from propranolol through its inhibition of the glucagon effect on CAMP (which propranolol does not possess) and also by inhibiting antigenic release of histamine.	In a sample of Bengali Muslems from Dacca, haptoglobin, group-specific component, haemoglobin, adenosine deaminase, adenylate kinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucomutase, acid phosphatase and several other red cell enzyme types were studied.	Of 12 patients who received streptokinase and plasminogen infusion, complete lysis of thrombi was obtained in 8 and partial but extensive lysis in 4.	In parallel studies with glucagon antibodies it could be established that the somatostatin positive cells and the glucagon positive cells were not identical but localized extremely close to each other.	The occurrence of probable somatostatin containing cells in the pancreatic islets is of special interest in view of several recent studies demonstrating an inhibitory action of this peptide on glucagon and insulin secretion.	Pretreatment with des-Glu-1-LH-RH, porcine corticotropin or rat prolactin has no effect.	An in vitro competitive binding study of 57Co-bleomycin with either 57Co-human serum albumin (HSA) or 57Co-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) showed the labeled bleomycin to be a strong chelate.	Plasma concentrations of glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol, glucose, and free fatty acids and blood concentrations of glycerol, 3-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, alanine, pyruvate, and lactate were measured in 38 fasting diabetic subjects deprived of their usual morning dose of insulin.	After autoradiography, the sections were pressed to a glass slide spread with a mixture of albumin and glycerin.	The core antigen was found to resist digestion by various enzymes such as protease, DNase, RNase, phospholipase C, lipase, lysozyme, diastase, neuraminidase and hyaluronidase, all of which did not destroy the immunoreactivity as demonstrated by immunoelectron and immunofluorescent microscopy.	In addition inhibitors of plasminogen activation were sought by studying the effects of separated fractions on the lysis of plasminogen-rich fibrin clots by urokinase.	2-bromo-alpha-ergocryptine (bromocriptine) in a dosage of 2-5 mg twice daily caused a rapid fall in plasma prolactin.	It is suggested that dopamine may modulate the normal secretion of aldosterone either directly, or indirectly, possible by inhibition of prolactin secretion.	However, small doses of insulin led to a poor retention of potassium.	In view of the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on both insulin and glucagon secretion, it is suggested that the arrangement of A, B and D cells is important to the normal and pathological functioning of the islet.	The binding properties of bilirubin, BPB, and some related dyes are spectrometrically investigated, and differences between the properties of human and bovine albumin and between such albumin preparations and human serum are shown and discussed.	Various tinctorial characteristics of B cells reveal that they correspond to the insulin producing B-cells of other vertebrates.	The haemoglobin, haematocrit, transferrin and serum iron of a group of 418 healthy medical students, aging from 18 till 25 years, were determined.	EEG (occipito-central, anterior and posterior temporo-central), blood concentration of hormones (oestradiol, progesterone, prolactin, folliculo-stimulating (FSH) and luteinizing (LH) hormones) and psychometric tests (reaction time, concentration, simple calculations, visual orientation and simple motor performance tasks) were recorded from 16 young women during a spontaneous menstrual cycle (s.c.w.	Hematologic indices and routine chemistries did not change significantly in these dogs during the procedure except for a decrease in mean serum albumin concentration and an increase in mean serum glucose concentration.	Whereas peroxidase is sensitive to aldehyde fixation and has its optimal pH in the neutral range, the staining for catalase requires prior fixation with glutaraldehyde and isoptimal at pH 10.5.	In three patients 2 to 3 h somatostatin infusions were twice superimposed upon a continuous 9-5 h insulin infusion (1 unit/h).	An insulin effect was noticeable within 30 minutes, with pronounced falls in the concentrations of plasma glucose, pancreatic glucagon, F.F.A., and blood-ketone-bodies.	Prolactin interferes with the function of the corpus luteum, as was demonstrated by repeatedly finding a short luteal phase in the ovulatory cycles of two hyperprolactinaemic women after prolactin supression by bromocriptine had been discontinued.	All these abnormalities may be treated by prolactin suppression, but the effect of treatment does not persist for long after bromocriptine administration ceases.	There is evidence that catecholamines and indolamines directly affect prolactin release.	In every case there was a substantial increase in the insulin response to combined stimulation of the pancreatic beta cells with 1 mg of glucagon and 2 g of tolbutamide given intravenously.	It is likely that the observed improvements reflected increased insulin stores which resulted from diazoxide inhibition of insulin release.	Pharmacological agents such as diazoxide, which inhibit glucose-induced insulin release, may have a place in preserving and restoring insulin secretion in diabetes.	Standard insulin hypoglycaemia tests performed 36 hours after the last dose of prednisolone often demonstrated impairment of corticotrophin (adrenocorticotrophic hormone, A.C.T.H.)	It seems likely that besides soluble retinal auto-antigens, outer segments contain a pathogenic insoluble antigen which seems to be linked to rhodopsin or to be rhodopsin itself.	Thus, in the nephrectomized rat gastrin (and pentagastrin) no longer evoked acid secretion, whereas it retained its ability to activate gastric histidine decarboxylase.	A study was made of the effect on sorption of the molecular weight of model proteins (ribonuclease with a molecular weight of 12 10(3), trypsin with a molecular weight of 24-10(3), bovine albumin with a molecular weight of 64-10(3) and gamma-globulin with a molecular weight of 160-10(3)) and dispersity of suspensions of aluminium hydroxide, aluminum phosphate and calcium phosphate used as biopreparation sorbents.	Various small fragments of (see article) which is one of the immunodominant groups of hen egg-white lysozyme (HL), were tested for macrophage migration inhibition (MMI) of peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) from guinea pigs immunized with HL.	Rabbit antisera to isoniazid (INH) and its major metabolite, isonicotinic acid (INA), were prepared by immunization with conjugates of these compounds with human serum albumin.	In the women with vitamin B6 deficiency, administration of this vitamin caused elevation of fasting blood-pyruvate levels, and reduction in plasma glucose, insulin, and blood-pyruvate responses after an oral glucose load.	While somatostatin was being given, basal values of renin were unchanged.	Injection of frusemide alone produced hyperreninaemia; but, under somatostatin, renin release was inhibited by 45%.	The results indicate that somatostatin is a potent inhibitor of renin and exerts its effect independent of sodium excretion, which was unchanged under somatostatin.	Conceivably, somatostatin plays an important role in the regulation of endogenous renin release.	Growth hormone release-inhibiting hormone (somatostatin), a hypothalamic peptide that inhibits the release of growth hormone and also the secretion of insulin glucagon, and gastrin, was found in the rat stomach and pancreas in a concentration similar to that in the hypothalamus, as measured by radioimmunoassay.	Changes in the concentrations of serum protein, albumin, cholesterol, and glucose were thought to be due to hemodilution.	The partition of zinc in human serum between two major zinc-binding proteins, albumin and alpha2-macroglobulin, was studied in 28 control subjects and in 156 hospitalized patients.	Over a wide range of values the concentrations of albumin-bound zinc and total serum zinc were highly correlated (r=0.91) with each other, as were concentrations of albumin and albumin-bound zinc (r=0.69).	To a large extent it appears that total serum zinc concentration reflects serum albumin concentration.	It was shown in the paraffine sections of the hepatoma cells fixed by mixture of 96 degrees ethanol with 1% glacial acetic acid that 9.3% of hepatoma cells contained AFP and 0.6% of the cells--serum albumin.	A radioimmunoassay for bleomycin has been produced using 125l-labeled bleomycin and antisera raised in rabbits against a carbodiimide-catalyzed bleomycin-bovine serum albumin conjugate.	Levels of total and albumin-bound zinc were significantly and positively correlated with serum albumin levels.	The effect of ouabain, a specific sodium-potassium dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Na+-K+-ATPase) inhibitor, on antigen-induced histamine release was studied using guinea pig lung fragments sensitized in vitro with rabbit antibodies against bovine serum albumin.	renin dependency after propranolol therapy suggests that suppression of P.R.A.	The relief of premenstrual symptoms by bromocriptine may be due to suppression of prolactin concentrations, which may be a major factor in premenstrual syndrome.	These studies suggest that the immunologic indicator in the radioimmune assay, 125I-iodoinsulin, selects antibody populations from within the antiserum that interact with determinants distant from the solvent surface on the insulin molecule to which iodine is substituted.	Stimulatory effects were seen when rat prostates were cultured in the presence of insulin (3 mug/ml) and testosterone (10(-7) mol/l), the incorporation on day 4 of culture being commensurate with that of fresh prostrate of the corresponding age.	This spontaneous surge in activity during culture tended to mask the stimulatory effects of insulin and testosterone at concentrations of 3 mug/ml and 10(-7) mol/l respectively.	Opposite to this, gelatin, dextran, hydroxyethyl starch, and albumin solutions are available as the mainstay of an adequate volume expansion.	At 60 min during the OGTT, triglyceride and insulin correlated significantly in pre-beta1-/Lp(a-) individuals, but not in pre-beta1 + or Lp (a+) individuals; on the other hand, insulin correlated significantly with blood glucose at this time in the pre-beta1 + and Lp(a+) individuals, but not in the pre-beta1-/Lp(a-).	It was sensitive to sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium deoxycholate, penicillin G, acridine orange, actinomycin D, phenethyl alcohol, and novobiocin and intermediately sensitive to acriflavine and lysozyme.	Thus, despite documented zinc deficiency, rats subjected to the stress of infection respond by synthesizing increased amounts of acute phase globulins apparently at the expense of serum albumin and muscle protein synthesis.	Implications of the hypothesis include possible new approaches to laboratory cultivation of rotaviruses, which should be more successful in cells selected for surface lactase activity, and the suggestion that the epidemiology of human rotavirus infections may be influenced by the fact that different ethnic groups have different lactase levels (and hence lactose intolerance) in adulthood.	The binding of both fluorescein labeled prolactin and estradiol to a variety of whole cells or to microsomal fragments has been observed by fluorescence microscopy.	In the nitrogen balances, in total protein and albumin concentration there were no differences, but serum gamma-globulin concentration of group II was very low at the end of the parenteral nutrition period, a point which at present cannot be explained.	Plasma proteins, in particular albumin or a contaminant of the albumin fraction tested, enhance the inhibitory effect of aspirin on platelet aggregation.	A mixture of histidine, cystine, and copper mimicked gold thiomalate, N-ethylmaleimide, and p-chloro-mercuribenzoic acid in inhibiting sulfhydryl-disulfide interchange-mediated denaturation of human gamma globulin, bovine serum albumin, and diluted human serum.	Porcine plasmin (EC 3.4.21.7) is obtained from plasminogen activated by human urokinase.	The fragmentation of native bovine serum albumin by trypsin has been studied in aqueous solution under various conditions with regard  to the yield and size of the fragments obtained.	In fresh serum this oxidation step may be performed by ceruloplasmin or molecular oxygen.	In 32 pairs of patients matched for age, sex, body weight, duration and treatment of diabetes, significantly higher haptoglobin, fibrinogen and caeruloplasmin levels were associated with the presence of diabetic complications, but blood glucose levels were not significantly different.	Double gel diffusion experiments using specific antisera ruled out the presence of trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasminogen, prothrombin, C1 esterase, alpha one-trypsin inhibitor, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor in the concentrated benzamidine eluate.	The effects of long term treatment with cortisone on the gastric secretion induced by histamine, pentagastrin, porcine gastrin and a meal have been investigated in four dogs with both gastric fistula and Heidenhain pouch.	X537A and nigericin inhibit the intralysosomal degradation of 125I-labelled albumin only when potassium is present.	The effect of glucocorticoids is of particular interest, both because their relative in vivo anti-inflammatory potencies correlate exactly with their effect on plasminogen activator production in culture and because this effect occurs at near physiological concentrations.	The isolated rat liver perfused for 12 hours at pH 7.10 with a suspension of bovine erythrocytes in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 3 per cent bovine serum albumin has been used as a test system to study effects of glucagon and of dexamethasone in the presence and absence of insulin on net biosynthesis of rat serum albumin, fibrinogen, alpah1-acid glycoprotein, alpha2-(acute phase) globulin, and haptoglobin.	Glucagon given with dexamethasone depressed albumin and haptoglobin synthesis markedly, but not that of fibrinogen and alpha1-acid glycoprotein.	The unfavorable effects of glucagon on albumin and haptoglobin synthesis and on nitrogen balance were reversed by giving insulin simultaneously.	It is emphasized that insulin is essential for positive nitrogen balance.	Peroxisomes were strongly reactive for catalase activity after incubation in diaminobenzidine medium, and reaction product of glucose-6-phosphatase activity was considerably greater following DMS fixation than after glutaraldehyde.	The difference in the ability of these agents to suppress renin release may be related to the presence (oxprenolol) or absence (propranolol) of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.	A double immunofluorescence technique, with antisera to pancreatic glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, and human pancreatic polypeptide was used to show that 13 of the sera contained anitbodies reacting specifically with glucagon cells, while the other 4 reacted with somatostatin cells.	However, when the labeled bleomycin is exposed to serum transferrin (and to other as yet unidentified ligands in the body) a difference in stability becomes obvious.	Activation of chymotrypsinogen by bovine trypsin or boar sperm acrosin was followed up using Nalpha-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester in a highly sensitive test system.	Solutions of these "elastica stains" in absolute ethanol colored only pseudo-elastica; elastin, e.g.	Infusion of somatostatin, an inhibitor of glucagon secretion, in insulin-dependent diabetics resulted in a 75-100% reduction in the blood-glucose rise after oral glucose administration, but did not improve intravenous glucose tolerance.	Such changes did not occur after exposure to neutral or anionic macromolecules (poly-DL-alanine, myoglobin, heparin, poly-L-glutamic acid and ovalbumin).	Plasma C-peptide and insulin response to an oral glucose load have therefore been assessed in 14 cirrhotic and 7 normal subjects.	The abnormal release of gastrin develops as a result of an impaired response to duodenal acidification manifest in part by an impaired release of secretin.	This material, which is urea stable, shows identical immunoassay dilution curves when measured with the highly specific K-30 glucagon antiserum.	The immunohistological demonstration of somatostatin-producing cells apposite to antral G-cells suggest a physiological role of somatostatin in the regulation of gastrin secretion in man.	This result confirms the specific enhancement of glutaminase I activity by ammonia in excess.	The immunofluorescence procedure was modified by pretreating sections with 5% bovine serum albumin, and by using fluorescein conjugates of F(ab)2 portions of antibodies to avoid the antigen-nonspecific binding that sometimes occurs in inflamed or necrotic tissue.	The patient with Parkinson' disease on chronic levodopa therapy, like the diabetic on insulin, is dependent on the drug.	Iodinated cell surface components from human thymus lymphocytes labeled by the lactoperoxidase method, were solubilized by papain digestion and then 3 M KCl extraction of the residual cell pellet.	Addition of insulin did not stimulate MMTV synthesis although dexamethasone alone was stimulatory in all media used; however, maximum MMTV expression was obtained when dexamethasone and insulin were used in concert.	Cell division is not promoted by insulin, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, linolenic acid, calcium, and typsin inhibitor form ovomucoid.	No differences were found in plasma tryptophan, glucose, insulin, and free fatty acid levels in the migraine/no-migraine categories.	18 mild, maturity onset diabetics have been treated with a basal insulin supplement provided by single daily injections of insulin zinc suspension (crystalline) 'Ultralente'.	The deposition of alpha-1-antitrypsin and alpha-2-macroglobulin, both known to be inhibitors of human skin collagenase, is significantly increased in keloids and in hypertrophic scars (as compared to normal skin).	Midodrine had no significant effect on glucose tolerance in either group, nor was there any significant effect of midodrine on FFA, serum insulin, triglyceride or cholesterol levels.	15 diabetic patients controlled by different therapeutic regimens (5 by diet only, 5 by oral preparations and 5 by insulin treatment) were given 3x5mg midodrine  orally over a 5-day period and the effects on diabetic control and metabolic parameters compared with a 5-day pretreatment period without midodrine.	Fibrinogen is a major plasma protein in intima in addition to LDL and albumin, and there are also substantial amounts of the protease inhibitors alpha2-macroglobulin and alpha1-antitrypsin.	Plasma zinc concentration decreased, and plasma seromucoid, lysozyme, and alpha2-macrofetoprotein increased during respiratory K. pneumoniae infection in rats.	Plasma zinc, alpha2-macrofetoprtoein, or lysozyme levels, however, did not change until the concentration of bacteria retrieved fron lungs exceeded 4 to 5 logs, Analysis of blood samples obtained serially from the orbital sinuses revealed that rats that succumbed to infection had significantly higher levels of seromucoid, alpha2-macrofetoprotein, and lysozyme and lower levels of plasma zinc than infected rats that survived.	The reduction in the ATP level coincided with a disappearance of the stimulatory effects of insulin on sugar transport and the hormone-sensitive phosphodiesterase.	When cells were incubated with [125I]iodoinsulin or insulin for 5 min at 15 degrees instead of 37 degrees, a negligible quantity of radioactivity accumulated in Peak 2 and insulin failed to activate sugar transport.	These results suggest that ATP, or some other compound metabolically related to ATP, may be necessary for the actions of insulin on sugar transport and phosphodiesterase.	Plasmin was a threefold better activator of latent enzyme than trypsin and could be generated by addition of plasminogen to synovial-cell cultures.	Production of both collagenase and plasminogen activator was inhibited by dexamethasone (10(-9) M).	These studies emphasize in importance of control of activation in regulation collagenase activity, It is likely that rheumatoid synovium produces both latent collagenase and plasminogen activator; plasmin is activated from its zymogen, plasminogen, present in inflamed tissues, and in turn activates collagenase.	The results were correlated with total iron-binding capacity, iron concentration, beta1 globulin and albumin levels.	In the remaining groups of patients transferrin concentration was decreased without regard to associated disturbances of iron metabolism and iron level.	In the rat, gastric mucosal histamine is mobilized and histidine decarboxylase activated by treatment with insulin or pentagastrin.	Common antigenic determinants between two species of pancreatic trypsin and twelve species of acrosin were studied using a highly sensitive, enzyme-linked immunoassay.	No common antigenic determinants between trypsin and acrosin could be detected.	Evidence that schizophrenia may be a prostaglandin deficiency disease comes from three main sources: (1) all effective antischizophrenic drugs stimulate prolactin secretion and prolactin is a potent stimulator of prostaglandin synthesis; (2) schizophrenics are resistant to pain and inflammation and are free of rheumatoid arthritis and there is increasing evidence that prostaglandins play important roles in pain, inflammation, and rheumatoid arthritis; (3) high doses of drugs recently shown to be prostaglandin antagonists cause schizophrenia-like syndromes.	The following parameters were analysed: total leucocytes, glucose, alkaline phosphatase (AP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein, albumin, total globulin, albumin/globulin ratio and electrophoretic protein picture.	Cells fromHodgkin's disease monolayers contained lysozyme (muramidase), fluoride-resistant alpha naphthol acetate esterase, acid and alkaline phosphatase, and chymotrypsin-like activity.	Peptide T1X was conjugated on to bovine serum albumin by glutaraldehyde and used for immunization of rabbits.	Glandular benign prostatic hyperplasia specimens from 10 patients were culutured for 4 days in media containing either insulin alone, insulin plus estradiol, insulin plus testosterone, insulin plus human placental lactogen, insulin plus human placental lactogen plus testosterone, or insulin plus human growth hormone plus testosterone.	Six of nine specimens were stimulated 80 per cent or more by insulin plus placental lactogen plus testosterone, but only one of seven was stimulated by insulin plus testosterone.	Four of 10 were stimulated by insulin plus estradiol.	A decrease of other major inhibitors, such as alpha2-macroglobulin and alpha1-antitrypsin, was not observed when the amount of urokinase added or infused was relatively small, and conversion of plasminogen to plasmin was not extensive.	The formation of plasmin-alpha2-macroglobulin complex was observed only when plasma plasminogen was activated with a larger amount of urokinase, and after most of the alpha2-plasmin inhibitor was consumed by forming complexes with plasmin.	There was no difference in blood glucose, free fatty acids, and insulin concentrations among the groups.	The plasma volume expansion after infusion of dextran 70 (Macrodex), hydroxyethylstarch (Volex), polygelatin (Haemaccel), albumin and saline was found to be between 790 and 180 ml.	Both phospholipase A and C were inhibitory; and the inhibitory effect of A could not be prevented by albumin or overcome with the addition of phosphatidylserine.	Tests on 50 chronic alcoholics demonstrated that there was a reduced supply of thiamine (measured with the transketolase activation test) and riboflavine (glutathione reductase test) compared with results obtained in 1152 healthy controls.	It is less characterized by lack of erythropoietin, but more by a strong lack of iron, moderate haemolysis and slight deficiency of folic acid.	It is proposed that in the hypertensive patients the raised prolactin levels reflect a defect in central dopamine control which is normalised by bromocriptine.	The oxidation of essential serum proteins, albumin and gamma globulin, by the enzyme peroxidase can be partially inhibited by compounds, such as EDTA and 2,4-pentanedione, that complex with the iron ion in peroxidase.	Purified sucrase-isomaltase complex sucrose alpha-glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.48 - dextrin 6-alpha-glycanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.10) solubilized by papain from rabbit intestine was dissociated by citraconylation into its subunits, sucrase and isomaltase, which were then isolated in a form active immunologically as well as enzymatically by affinity chromatography on Sephadex G-200 and gel-filtration on Bio-gel P-300.	Addition of albumin, gamma-globulin, alpha-casein or submaxillary mucin to the assay system for chromogenic measurement of human or rat amylase with blue starch increased the amylase activity, albumin having the most effect.	Of the total bound coumarin (37% of injected dose), 36% was bound to slow and fast oc1 globulins, 11% to the post albumins, 10% to globulin and 9% to albumin.	Eight individuals with Huntington's chorea had low basal and impaired human prolactin responses to both chlorpromazine and thyrotrophin-releasing hormone.	Two juvenile rigid patients with Huntington's chorea had excessive prolactin responses to chlorpromazine.	Approximately half of the twenty-three potentially affected first-degree relatives of patients with Huntington's chorea had normal prolactin responses to chlorpromazine.	Plasma-arginine vasopressin reached a peak 30 min after injection of insulin.	Plasma concentrations of arginine vasopressin obtained with hypoglycaemia were similar to those achieved after overnight dehydration for 14-16 h. No rise in plasma-arginine-vasopressin was observed in three patients with cranial diabetes insipidus in whom severe hypoglycaemia developed after insulin infusion.	The transfection of the cells was performed in the presence of bovine serum albumin and sucrose (Osowiecki and Skalińska, 1974).	The effects of the bilateral nephrectomy and acute hypotension caused by the cava vein ligature on the norepinephrine (NE) concentration in hypothalamus and medulla oblongata and on the plasma renin activity were studied in male rats.	Our results show that arginine administration does not suppress the decrease in the hepatic glutamine level and the marked activation of liver glutaminase I induced by ammonia.	Immunodiffusion and double-antibody immunoprecipitation studies of cell extracts and media after incubation of cells with l-[(35)S]methionine supported the radioimmunoassay finding that adherent cells from lung synthesized and secreted more alpha-2-macroglobulin than adherent cells from skin.	A 30-day exposure of test subjects to carbon monoxide at a concentration of 20-15 mg/m3 caused an increase of albumin, beta-globulins, total lipids, cholesterol, beta-lipoproteins in the serum and a decrease of the sugar concentration in the blood.	The percentage saturation of transferrin was elevated in all relatives with increased iron stores but also in 33% of relatives with normal iron stores.	The influence of glucagon and aprotinin ('Trasylol') on the death-rate of acute pancreatitis has been studied in a randomised double-blind multicentre trial.	The removal of fibre from food, and also its physical disruption, can result in faster and easier ingestion, decreased satiety, and disturbed glucose homoeostasis which is probably due to inappropriate insulin release.	In contrast, propranolol administration in 22 patients lowered active renin in all, but it increased prorenin by 98% in 15 in whom systolic pressure fell.	Thus, sodium depletion stimulates total renin release, while propranolol and clonidine produce divergent responses of active renin and prorenin, the changes in prorenin depending on the changes induced in blood-pressure.	These observations suggest that propranolol may block intrarenal conversion of prorenin to active renin while also suppressing total renin release.	Specific autoantibodies of neutralizing character to histamine, serotonin, kallikrein, bradykuinine, acetylcholine, adrenalin, noradrenalin, insulin, and to the serotonin metabolite--5-hydroxyindolacetic acid, were found in donor serum (47.2%) and in intact rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, and mice (24.4%).	By means of immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence methods sequentially applied on the same section, it was shown that the somatostatin cells are distinct from the gastrin cell population; these two endocrine cell types are often closely related.	Concentrations of prolactin, oestrogen, and triglycerides were significantly higher in ductal fluid than in plasma, but there was little difference with cholesterol concentration.	It was confirmed that phenytoin was almost exclusively albumin-bound, while phenobarbitone was bound to albumin, alpha 1-and alpha 2-globulin in almost equal proportions.	The serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol-17beta, and progesterone were determined simultaneously with the concentrations of immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA, C'3, alpha1-antitrypsin, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor, alpha1x-antichymotrypsin, albumin, and lysozyme in cervical mucus during nine  ovulatory cycles.	The midcycle period, characterized by the rapid increase and decline of estrogen and the beginning rise of progesterone, shows a prounced minimum of immunoglobulins, C'3, proteinase inhibitors, albumin, and lysozyme in cervical mucus, which is known to be most receptive to sperm penetration at this time.	The site of greatest affinity for zinc had an apparent stoichiometry (n1 in gatoms/mol of alpha-2-macroglobulin monomer) of 12 and an apparent association constant (K1) of 3.06.10(7).	The trypsin binding activity of alpha-2-macroglobulin did not depend on the presence of zinc in this protein since all but traces of this metal could be removed by EDTA without loss of trypsin binding activity.	Saturation of site 1 with zinc did not affect the trypsin binding activity of alpha-2-macroglobulin, but binding of the metal by site 2 progressively decreased the trypsin binding activity by causing an irreversable association of the alpha-2-macroglobulin molecules.	Removal of excess zinc from alpha-2-macroglobulin did not restore its trypsin binding activity.	Our results also indicate that the high zinc content of alpha-2-macroglobulin (320--770 microgram/g protein) reported in the literature is an artifact and that native alpha-2-macroglobulin contains approximately 150--180 microgram Zn/g protein.	Hepatic glucose efflux is very sensitive to changes in plasma-insulin and it is postulated that this provides an important feedback control of insulin secretion.	), insulin, cholesterol, or triglycerides rise--cellular immunity becomes depressed.	When 125I-labelled albumin and IgG or 14C-oestrogen and testosterone were injected intraperitoneally in newborn rats, the labelled proteins and hormones were detected in fetal blood and CSF four hours after the injection.	Acute stimulation of renin release by isoprenaline, tilting, or diazoxide in 13 normotensive individuals and in 9 patients with essential hypertension increased active plasma-renin and reduced inactive plasma-renin.	Inactive plasma-renin was increased and active plasma-renin decreased during suppression of renin release by propranolol in 12 patients with essential hypertension.	Neither was any change found in the concentration of P&P-complex (prothrombin, factor VII, factor X), factor VIII, antithrombin III, alpha1-antitrypsin, alpha2-macroglobulin or the inhibitors of urokinase induced plasminogen activation.	Dexamethasone, prednisone and prednisolone each increased zinc uptake by 40--50% when either insulin or glucagon was also present.	There was no significant difference between the boys and the adults concerning maximal oxygen uptake, plasma volume, albumin, immunoglobins, and haptoglobin, when allowance was made for differences in body dimensions; probably due to the young age, however, the boys had considerably higher relative alpha2-macroglobulin and transferrin masses.	When the isoprenaline-induced changes of heart-rate, diastolic pressure, and plasma renin activity without propranolol were compared to those with propranolol, these responses were greatly diminished (P less than 0.01 to less than 0.001).	Monospecific antiserums to the azurophilic markers myeloperoxidase, elastase, cathepsin G and lysozyme, and to the specific granule markers lactoferrin and lysozyme, were labeled with fluorescein and rhodamine and were used to demonstrate two antigens in the same cell simultaneously.	Incubation of rat lymphatic tissue with insulin failed to produce a factor potentiating the histamine-releasing action of dextran when this was studied in both in vivo and in vitro tests.	It thus seems that insulin is exerting its potentiating effect on the dextran response through processes not involving synthesis of new protein or interaction with lymphocytes.	The purified enzyme did not show any chitinase, hyaluronidase or lysozyme activity.	The plasma-potassium rose promptly after a drink of 50 g glucose in 8 insulin-dependent diabetics who had not had insulin for approximately 14-26 hours.	The therapy included glucose, insulin and heparin administration, balance of acidosis and partial exchange of blood, which resulted in improvement in the glucose level, coagulation factors and acidosis, but could not prevent further liver damage and uraemia with a fatal outcome.	The correlation between plasma zinc and plasma albumin levels in all 34 patients studied was highly significant (rs = 0.69, p less than 0.001).	As plasma albumin tends to fall to subnormal concentrations with age, this explains why plasma zinc may be low in the elderly without indicating a state of zinc deficiency.	It is concluded that urokinase diffused into the artificial thrombi can convert plasminogen, trapped onto fibrin in threads to plasmin.	Antibodies can be detected to a limited number of drugs such as penicillin, ACTH, TSH, insulin, asparaginase and proteins of animal sources.	The haemoglobin, haematocrit, erythrocyte count, transferrin and serum iron values of a group of 65 healthy young people aging from 18-25 years were determined.	It is also associated with inhibition of gastrointestinal somatostatin, causing a release of gastrin and insulin.	No significant differences were found between the lithium treated patients and control subjects in the transversal study in either albumin, beta2-microglobulin or free light chain excretion.	It is not clear whether the increased and sustained albumin excretion in one of the patients was due to lithium or was conincidental.	Significant increases of serum alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha-2-M) were detected in narcotic addicts presenting at a methadone treatment center.	Anitibodies were prepared against poly(adenosine diphosphoribose) of an average chain length of 40 adenosine diphosphoribose units by repeated injection of the polymer mixed with methylated albumin and adjuvants into rabbits.	Fluoresceinated albumin and gamma-globulin did not bind to the lymphocytes, and a 500-fold excess of native non-fluoresceinated thyroglobulin inhibited the binding and pre-incubation with anti-IgM serum abolished it.	Serum prolactin, growth hormone, and alpha-fetoprotein were determined in women taking a new oral contraceptive, consisting of 2 mg cyproterone acetate and 50 microgram of ethinylestradiol.	During one year of treatment with cyproterone acetate and ethinylestradiol there was a continuous rise of serum concentrations of prolactin.	Unsaturated vitamin B12 binding capacity (UBBC) and serum lysozyme activity (LZM) were estimated durinng the endotoxin, prednisone and hydrocortisone marrow granulocyte reserve (MGR) pool tests.	The steroid--receptor complex was found to have a sedimentation coefficient of 4--5 S with respect to bovine serum albumin after sucrose density-gradient centrifugation.	The changes discussed here were observed only in those animals in which the transplant was functional and they were amplified or reversed by modulators of prolactin secretion such as oestrogens or bromocriptine respectively.	The pH dependence of the copper(II)-binding ability of alpha-fetoprotein was quite similar to that of albumin.	Chemical studies indicate that palladium binds directly to purified bovine ligamentum nuchae elastin and that this binding is not affected by glutaraldehyde fixation or by sodium borohydride reduction of elastin.	Following fixation with formalin or glutaraldehyde, the protein content of bovine serum albumin, lysozyme, non-disintegrated yeast cells and liver nuclei of mice is determined by means of a brom-phenol blue staining procedure and the widely used Lowry-technique.	A 17beta-estradiol-6-carboxymethyl-oxime-bovine serum albumin--fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate is prepared by attaching on the average 11 moles of the fluorescein dye and 24 moles of the steroid hormone to each mole of the protein carrier.	Plasma glucose decreased from a mean value of 250 mg/100 ml to 117 mg/100 ml during the first 85 min after insulin.	Antisera to Friend virus gp71, p30, p15E, p12 and p10 were employed in a complement-dependent chromium release assay and to immunoprecipitate lactoperoxidase iodinated surface polypeptides prior to analysis in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.	The combination of ALP, GOT, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), albumin, globulin, and GGTP tests is useful for routine differential diagnosis.	Secondaries in the lung emerged, however, after administration of agents such as trypsin, 10% dextrose or antiserum to alpha-2-macroglobulin (AMG).	It is suggested that hepatic uptake of orally ingested glucose depends not only on insulin secretion but also on the release of a gastrointestinal factor which mediates insulin action on the liver.	Antibody absorption studies with anti-TRH sera absorbed with TRH, 3 diastereoisomeric analogues of TRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), bovine serum albumin, thyrotropin, prolactin, adrenocorticotropin, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone were performed to determine the specificity of the staining reaction.	Unlike trypsin, factor D cleaves and activates factor B only when it is in Mg++-dependent complex with C3b, has no esterolytic activity, and is unable to cleave the B chain of insulin.	Also, antigen-induced histamine release from peritoneal mast cells actively immunized with egg albumin glucosamine.	Potential mechanisms of the influence on the blood sugar level are discussed; four action mechanisms are assumed--the effect on insulin secretion and on the sensitivity to it, the effect on the liver, on disturbances of fat metabolism, and on increase of glucose use in the peripheral tissues.	Immunoelectrophoresis of the enzyme at pH 8.6 against anti-tadpole collagenase rabbit immunoglobulin G shows a single precipitin line at a position migrating faster than human serum albumin and corresponding to enzyme activity against collagen fibril and synthetic substrates.	Interaction of a spin labeled corticosteroid (desoxycorticosterone nitroxyde: DOC -NO) with three purified proteins (albumin, transcortin, progesterone binding protein: PBG) was studied by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy.	Of 448 insulin-dependent diabetics receiving conventional insulins, 63% had circulating antibodies to human P.P., 6% antibodies to V.I.P., 6% to glucagon, and 0.5% to somatostatin.	Six different plasmins were prepared by incubating human plasminogen with various amounts of streptokinase or urokinase.	However, plasmin activated by complex formation of plasminogen with streptokinase was not so immediately or effectively inhibited by alpha 2-macroglobulin.	In gel chromatography, paper electrophoresis and acetate cellulose electrophoresis it was demonstrated that the latent capacity for iron saturation is a feature of not only transferrin belonging to beta1 globulins, but also to some extent of albumins and alpha-globulins.	The authors present a reliable and sensitive estimation of progesterone using a conjugate progesterone IIalpha-hémimaleate-beta galactosidase to identify the immunological reaction, the antibodies being obtained from the rabbit by means of a progesterone 11alpha-hemisuccinate bovine serum albumin.	An inhibitory effect on the lymphocyte culture in vitro was shown dependent on the amount, by human placental lactogen, alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, cortisol, progesterone and SPI glycoprotein and alpha-2-macroglobulin.	An investigation of two unrelated patients who had local cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions after injection of any commercially available insulin preparation has shown that the cause of the allergy was zinc.	The number of patients in whom zinc (which is present in all commercially available insulin preparations) is a cause of "insulin" allergy is unknown.	To study the effects of improved control of blood glucose on markers of renal glomerular and tubular function, we initially determined, by radioimmunoassay technics, urinary excretion rates of albumin and beta2 microglobulin in 17 nondiabetic subjects and in 43 insulin-dependent, clinically nonproteinuric diabetic patients.	152 lung scans carried out with two indicators, bleomycin labelled with 57 Co and microspheres of albumin labelled with 99mTc have been examined.	Eighty-six members of seven families with idiopathic hemochromatosis were screened for abnormalities in iron metabolism with tests for serum iron concentration, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin concentration and iron content of the hepatocytes.	DAMME and other substances with opiate-like activity, such as morphine and beta-endorphin, affect carbohydrate metabolism and insulin secretion.	The response to intravenous insulin was studied in seven diabetics after a dose of placebo, propranolol (40 mg), or metoprolol (50 mg).	Hepatocytes in early and late cultures secreted albumin, transferrin, and alpha1-acid glycoprotein into the medium; they exhibited a 7- to 10-fold induction of tyrosine aminotransferase activity by dexamethasone; and they expressed an alkaline phosphatase that was similar to that of normal rat liver with respect to its inhibition by the liver enzyme inhibitor L-homoarginine.	The mentioned hormones as well as hydrocortisone and insulin would not prevent the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) infecting of CEC, render no essential action on the accumulation of RSV in the infected CEC culture, and failed to activate the formation of mature RSV in virogenic cultures of rat (XC, R--B77) and mice cells (DBA--B77).	Patients with coeliac disease have a highly significant reduction in the release of secretin and gastric inhibitory polypeptide from the upper small intestine, but a greatly increased release of enteroglucagon, and also of neurotensin, from the lower part of the small intestine.	The measurement of testosterone (T), 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol (3alpha-diol) oestradiol (Oe2), sex-hormone-binding-globulin binding capacity (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and prolactin (Prl) in the blood of normal men (group I) and those with BPH (group II or III) demonstrated no significant differences between the three groups when respective age ranges were compared.	The bacterium produces unique, branched-chain fatty acids, catalase, oxidase (weakly), and gelatinase and uses starch while ignoring other carbohydrates.	It appeared that the elastase inhibitory capacity was influenced more by the alpha-1-antitrypsin level while the trypsin inhibitory capacity was more sensitive to alpha-2-macroglobulin.	The hapten was prepared by trypsin digestion of the glucagon, which was proved to be a 1:3 mixture of glucagon (18--29) and (19--29).	containing 75 microgram or more oestrogen, and this was associated with impairment of the early insulin response to glucose.	The binding affinity of probenecid and analogues for kidney tissue, phospholipid vesicles (liposomes) and human serum albumin increased in the order : p-piperidyl sulfamyl benzoic acid less than p-benzyl sulfamyl benzoic acid less than di-n-propyl sulfamyl benzoic acid (probenecid).	Analysis of poly(A) content by a hybridization assay with [3H]poly(U) revealed the presence in albumin mRNA of a poly(A) region containing approximately 100 adenosine residues.	The polyadenylic acid-containing RNA, subsequently purified by differential sedimentation on sucrose gradient and oligodeoxythymidylic acid-cellulose chromatography, migrates as a single 21S component in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; in a cell-free translation system, it yields a peptide product immunoprecipitable by anti-rat AFP antiserum, but not by anti-rat albumin, and which migrates slightly faster than serum AFP on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gels.	Blood-levels of glucose and the major intermediary metabolites, lactate, pyruvate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and alanine, were measured in 7 insulin-dependent diabetics during 24 h of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (C.S.I.I.)	Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids were elevated during conventional insulin treatment but fell to normal after 7 days of pump treatment.	Specifically, clofibrate at 140mg/kg muted the increase in alpha(2)-macrofoetoprotein, but did not affect that of seromucoid or haptoglobin and only transiently inhibited the rise in copper and the rebound in transferrin.	A higher dose, 280mg/kg, markedly suppressed alpha(2)-macrofoetoprotein appearance and the rebound in transferrin, somewhat inhibited the increase in seromucoid and haptoglobin and only transiently affected the rise in plasma copper; 420mg of clofibrate/kg very nearly abolished the appearance of alpha(2)-macrofoetoprotein, markedly suppressed the transferrin rebound and the increases in seromucoid and haptoglobin and again only transiently affected the increase in copper.	Clofibrate of itself, apart from inflammation, produced decreases in plasma zinc, copper, transferrin and seromucoid and an increase in hepatic amino acid uptake that were to some extent dependent on the dose of the drug.	Glucagon (10microM), gastric inhibitory peptide (0.1 microM), substance, P, neurotensin, octapeptide of cholecystokinin, bovine pancreatic polypeptide, human gastrin I with leucine at residue 15, Leu-enkephalinand somatostatin (1 microM) did not alter cyclicAMP levels.	Their antigenicity is destroyed by oxidation but is unaffected by neuraminidase, lysozyme, or trypsin.	The hemispherically separated water and electrolyte contents of the brain were analyzed after 24 h. Following furosemide therapy, the behavior of these edema parameters was compared statistically with dexamethasone, glycerol and albumin.	By contrast, the administration of dexamethasone, glycerol and albumin was followed by a significant improvement of the edema.	However, plasma-renin rose progressively over the 2 years even in 5 of 8 patients whose renin was not stimulated initially by diuretics.	A similar action on human lactase could be a cause of lactose intolerance.	Addition of insulin and thyroxine to the medium results in a marked enhancement of porphyrin accumulation.	glucagon, sodium fluoride, cAMP or its dibutyryl derivative, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and papaverine enhanced drug-induced porphyrin biosynthesis.	A low level of porphyrin accumulation occurs at insulin to glucagon ratios similar to those found following glucose administration in vivo, suggesting a possible explanation for the therapeutic effect of glucose in hepatic porphyria.	Derivatives of estrone were prepared and linked to bovine serum albumin or its methyl-esterified form to produce immunogens which were effective in raising antisera to estrone sulfate.	Estrone-3-phosphate covalently or electrostatically linked to bovine serum albumin also produced antisera reactive to estrone sulfate.	The interaction between thrombin and alpha-2-macroglobulin was studied on human purified materials, either in the presence or in the absence of heparin, by kinetic analysis of thrombin inhibition and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.	In the absence of heparin, binding of thrombin to alpha-2-macroglobulin, shown by electrophoresis, leads to the loss of the coagulant property of the enzyme.	In the presence of heparin the rate of inhibition of thrombin clotting activity by alpha-2-macroglobulin is strongly decreased.	These data show that heparin paradoxically protects thrombin from inhibition by alpha-2-macroglobulin whereas it increases the enzyme inhibition by antithrombin III.	Serum levels of testosterone, FSH, LH and prolactin were measured by RIA in patients with BPH (benign prostatic hypertrophy) and in control men.	Serum concentrations of FSH, LH, prolactin and estradiol, did not differ significantly in the 2 groups.	thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and lactoperoxidase), such as inorganic iodide exchange for organic iodine in di-iodotyrosine (DIT) and the de-iodination of thyroxine (T4), were also catalysed by the sonicated leucocyte suspension in the system used.	Since prolactin has several modes of action on prostatic growth and physiology, the effect of the antiprolactin bromocriptine on plasma kinetics and intraprostatic metabolism of testosterone was studied in patients with untreated prostatic cancer; a therapy protocol was deduced which was controlled in 27 patients with advanced inoperable prostatic adenocarcinoma.	Bromocriptine resulted in a significant suppression of prolactin and testosterone as well and favored testosterone elimination from the plasma pool.	The difference spectrum observed as a result of the specific binding of bilirubin to alpha-fetoprotein had a maximum at 482 nm, and this pattern was quite similar to that observed for serum albumin.	These results indicate that alpha-fetoprotein may function as a carrier protein for bilirubin as has been shown for serum albumin.	100 mg BAY g 5421, given before a 50 g sucrose meal, produced pronounced attenuation of both hyperglycaemic and hypoglycaemic phases of plasma glucose levels; and it greatly reduced the rise in plasma levels of gastric inhibitory polypeptide and insulin.	Malignant hypertension with severe hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, depletion of sodium and potassium, and elevated blood levels of renin, angiotensin I, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and arginine vasopressin developed in a woman with renal-artery occlusion.	A difference between the spectral changes brought about by alpha-fetoprotein and albumin allowed comparison of their relative affinities for bilirubin.	These results show that alpha-fetoprotein from two species binds bilirubin with an affinity somewhat lower than that of albumin.	Binding of bilirubin by alpha-fetoprotein is in agreement with the recent demonstration of structural homology between alpha-fetoprotein and albumin.	Twenty-six patients with primary lung cancer were studied in whose blood we found a significant increase in the levels of copper, ceruloplasmin, lactic-dehydrogenase and alpha 2-globulins.	Plasma neutral aminoacid concentrations are deranged, partly, but not completely, because ammonia stimulates glucagon secretion; a high rate of gluconeogenesis and hyperinsulinaemia follow.	Several eucaryotic proteins, including insulin, growth hormone, ovalbumin, dihydrofolate reductase and somatostatin have been produced in bacteria.	Neither carbachol nor gastrin increased cyclic AMP production beyond that produced by IMX alone, and the combinations of histamine and carbachol and of histamine and gastrin produced no greater cyclic AMP generation than produced by histamine.	These findings support a close relationship between cyclic AMP production and the action of histamine but not of carbachol or gastrin on isolated parietal cells.	The mechanisms underlying the potentiating interactions between histamine, carbachol, and gastrin involve step(s) beyond stimulation of cyclic AMP generation.	Although conclusions based solely on such correlations should be considered with reservation, in our opinion the following factors should stimulate platelet function: prealbumin (adhesion and PF 3-availability in all age-groups, aggregation--specifically for children in puberty); alpha 1-antitrypsin (PF 3-availability); alpha 2-macroglobulin (platelet spreading capacity, PF 3-availability); plasminogen (platelet adhesion and aggregation--specifically for boys in puberty); caeruloplasmin (number of "free adhering platelets" spreading capacity); lysolecithin and lecithin (time-dependent increase of spontaneous platelet adhesion and aggregation, PF 3-availability); and free fatty acids (FFA) (PF 3-availability).	The antibody responses to DNP-bovine gamma globulin, bovine gamma globulin, human serum albumin, ovalbumin, pepsin and five synthetic polypeptides were examined in strains of inbred rats representative of eight common major histocompatibility complex (RTI) haplotypes.	Addition of insulin did not produce an increase on glucose oxidation and a slight increase in the incorporation into total lipids was observed.	Leukocyte extracts, trypsin, and lysozyme are all capable of releasing the bulk of the LPS from S. typhi, S. typhimurium, and E. coli.	The capacity of normal peritoneal macrophages to pinocytose an oxygen intermediate scavenger, soluble catalase, was also demonstrated.	On standard diets, about 10% of the animals became obese, and some showed decreased glucose tolerance, elevated serum immunoreactive insulin and diabetic changes in the pancreas and other organs.	A comparison of the metabolic effects of salbutamol in diabetic patients and normal subjects showed that salbutamol infused at 5 and 2 microgram/min (a) stimulated hepatic glucose production to a greater extent in diabetic patients than in normal subjects despite prior restoration of the diabetic patients' fasting blood glucose to normal by an overnight infusion of insulin; (b) caused a greater rise in plasma glucose, free fatty acids, glycerol, and ketone-body concentrations in the diabetic patients; and (c) produced a marked fall in plasma-potassium concentrations.	Subsequent studies indicated that the gums and viscous types of fibre (e.g., guar and pectin) are more effective than other fibres in slowing carbohydrate absorption and hence in reducing the postprandial rise in blood glucose and serum insulin.	Applicability of this method to cryostat sections, without glutaraldehyde fixations prior to freezing, allowed the myoglobin content of individual muscle fibers to be correlated with other histochemical characteristics of the same fibers seen in serial sections.	In the dark red bovine sternomandibularis muscle, fibers with weak adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and strong succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity always exhibited strong myoglobin staining.	The specific Cu(II)-binding site of bleomycin has been compared with that of human serum albumin.	Mediastinal radiotherapy is indicated after removal of an invasive or adhesive thymoma.	Haematological investigations of peripheral blood and bone marrow were performed in rabbits receiving hydrazinophthalazines (hydralazine or binazin) with or without simultaneous hyperimmunization by means of repeated injections of bovine albumin.	Both 'endogenous' alkaline- and kallikrein-activation of plasma renin can be inhibited by aprotinin.	To assess whether insulin acts directly on the exocrine pancreas, or through the enhancement of glucose utilization, animals were fed either a low-fat diet or a high-fat diet during insulin treatment; this latter diet is well known to impair insulin's effect on glucose metabolism.	When diabetic rats were fed a low-fat diet, insulin treatment was able to correct the hyperketonemia and to reverse the amylase to lipase ratio to the prediabetes level.	In contrast, the insulin treatment failed to restore the amylase to lipase ratio when the diabetic rats were fed the high-fat diet.	Despite insulin treatment, the hyperketonemia worsened implying that glucose utilization remained low as would be expected on high-fat diet.	The dependence of the insulin effect upon diet composition demonstrates that the rate of glucose metabolism is the primary factor in the regulation of amylase to lipase ratio.	Rates of cell proliferation essentially equal to those in 10% serum were obtained when Yaffe's L6 myoblasts were incubated in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10(-5) M fetuin, 10(-6) M insulin, and 10(-7) M dexamethasone; we have designated this mixture muscle medium-1 (MM-1).	Serum zinc, albumin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, calcium, and magnesium were measured in 39 jejuno-ileal shunt-operated patients.	The binding of serum zinc to albumin and alpha 2-macroglobulin were calculated.	We report the equilibrium binding parameters for the interactions of the estrogen analogue diethylstilbestrol (DES) with highly purified rat alpha 1-fetoprotein (AFP) and serum albumin preparations.	We found that pyridoxine at concentrations of 10 (-3) M, or greater significantly inhibited rat mast cell degranulation and histamine release induced by phospholipase A, compound 48/80, antigen (egg albumin) or a mixture of dextran and phosphatidyl serine, respectively.	The phenomenon of plasma renin activattion by acid dialysis and preincubation with trypsin was studied in normal human plasma.	Trypsin and acid exposure gave similar results with regard to the activation of this zymogen, suggesting that trypsin and acid dialysis may increase plasma renin activity by the same mechanism.	The effects of prazosin and phentolamine, alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists with different in vitro selectivities for the presynaptic alpha-receptor, on mean arterial pressure and serum renin activity were determined in the conscious rat.	However, consistent with the greater selectivity of prazosin for the postsynaptic alpha-receptor, a given reduction in arterial pressure was associated with a lesser increment in heart rate and serum renin activity after prazosin than after the nonselective agent phentolamine.	The intravenous administration of 80 units crystalline zinc insulin produced both hypokalemia (3.78 +/- 0.22 reduced to 2.36 +/- 0.18 mEq potassium/liter plasma) and a reappearance of ventricular tachycardia despite no change in plasma and myocardial tissue concentrations of disopyramide from those which had been effective in establishing and maintaining sinus rhythm.	Glycosylated haemoglobin levels correlated with prevailing blood glucose and with the type of therapy employed, and were highest in the insulin dependent diabetics, intermediate in those on tablets and lowest in those on diet alone.	We studied the effects of labetalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on maximum exercise heart rate and on plasma renin, aldosterone, noradrenaline, and adrenaline levels at rest and during exercise in hypertensive patients.	Plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration at rest decreased during treatment with labetalol.	The exercise-induced increase in plasma renin activity was reduced by labetalol.	Addition of either prazosin or methyldopa to hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure significantly and to a similar degree without altering plasma renin activity.	In contrast to rabbit blood plasma, in guinea pig and rat blood plasma activation of fibrinolysis by streptokinase is achieved after addition of human plasminogen or human plasma only.	Erythropoiesis has been used as a system for studying the molecular mechanism of regulation of gene action by means of two hormones: erythropoietin and testosterone.	The incorporation of 3H-GTP and 3H-UTP into RNA by isolated rat bone marrow nuclei is stimulated by erythropoietin and testosterone.	Using alpha-amanitine and different ionic strength conditions it was found that erythropoietin enhances preferentially RNA polymerase II activity while testosterone increases RNA polymerase I activity.	It is postulated that erythropoietin and testosterone act synergically to create the biochemical machinery for hemoglobin synthesis, the macromolecule that characterizes the erythropoietic process.	It is almost always used in association with a colloidal solution, very often human albumin or a dextran.	The local oedema induced by subplantar injection of dextran was found to be much less sensitive to insulin.	Sensitization by a single insulin dose to both systemic and local dextran was suppressed in rats older than 6 months, and the refractoriness was in part reversed by adrenalectomy.	Conjugates of the benzylpenicilloyl (BPO), benzylpenicillenate (BPE) and penicillamine (PA) groups with human serum albumin (HSA) and bovine gamma globulin (BGG) have been made.	The activities of lysozyme, acid and alkaline phosphatases, beta-glucuronidase, amylase, lipase, glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase, and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase in the whole hemolymph and 4000 g pellets and supernatants of Mya arenaria were determined.	Neurotensin (NT), substance P (SP) and morphine sulfate (MS) elevate plasma prolactin and growth hormone levels in both normal or estrogen-progesterone pretreated male rats.	Three hours after transplantation normalization of blood sugar levels and serum insulin could be observed; these levels remained stable over 18 months.	A close association between high serum iron, low serum transferrin, and high incidence of bacterial infection was found.	It is characterized by increasing E2 secretion, low progesterone secretion and slightly increased prolactin levels, with a frequently impaired luteal phase.	The changes in HPZ and reflux status in response to infusion of various doses of secretin, cholecystokinin and glucagon were measured in all animals, and, in the 5 non-refluxing monkeys, after oesophagogastrectomy with replacement of the lower oesophagus by a stomach tube.	Other measurements included: total calcium, bound calcium, total magnesium, bound magnesium, albumin, globulin, total protein, phosphate, pH, and hematocrit.	Thus, intravascular protein tracers such as Evans' blue-albumin, 125I-labelled albumin, horseradish peroxidase (ED 1.11.1.7) and alpha-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24) are allowed into the brain, and uptake of [3H] norepinephrine (noradrenaline) is increased more than twofold above a normal rate of accumulation by brain.	Maturity onset diabetes (MOD) is characterized by the fact that the response of insulin secretion to glucose loading is either completely missing or is reduced if compared with that of persons whose metabolism is intact.	The effect of glucose on insulin release and the influence of glibenclamide on linear growth were determined in five growth hormone (STH) deficient children who were treated with human growth hormone.	These findings lead to the conclusion that the beneficial action of glucagon is due to another mechanism other than its hyperglycemic effect and that the administration of hypertonic solutions of glucose does not have a beneficial effect in acute pancreatitis.	However, the modification alters the properties of the binding site either by an incomplete refolding of the albumin after urea treatment, or a more selective allosteric effect of the modified tryptophan residue.	The appearance of the oxygenated form with the addition of hydrogen peroxide was probably due to the reaction of the reduced cytochrome with the oxygen that had evolved by the action of catalase present in the cells.	The effect of methylphenidate on serum prolactin was utilized as a method of evaluating methylphenidate's central dopamimergic effects.	Thus, its effect on serum prolactin does not parallel its behavioral activating properties, suggesting that such activation may not involve dopamine.	Circulating levels of FSH, LH, prolactin (Prl), estradiol (E), and progesterone (P) were determined by RIA in four intact and four monkeys luteectomized (CLX) at parturition in order to a) characterize the patterns of these hormones during the puerperium, and b) examine a possible inhibitory role of the "rejuvenated" corpus luteum (CL) on the resumption of follicle growth post partum.	Correlation between individual values for A after lactase and after lactulose was significant.	The degree of thiamine deficiency was measured by the activity coefficient of transketolase in the red blood cells.	In addition, the Ca requirement for the epinephrine stimulatory effect and for the ouabain inhibitory action on renin release was also tested.	In contrast, when the K concentration was 59 mM, a significant inhibition of renin release was attained with all concentrations of calcium.	In addition, both the stimulatory effect of epinephrine and the inhibitory effect of ouabain on renin release required Ca in the medium.	In addition to being three to four times more potent than tolbutamide, McN-3495 also differs from the sulfonylureas in lowering blood glucose concentrations of streptozotocin-diabetic rats and db/db mice, and, moreover, oral administration to normal fasted dogs did not produce the characteristic rise in insulin concentrations observed with tolbutamide.	arginine-induced glucagon levels and augmented arginine-stimulated insulin release in the ether anesthetized rat.	Serum insulin concentration was measured during infusion of glucose, fructose or sorbitol for several days in polytraumatized patients.	In patients with disturbed glucose tolerance the glucose substitutes (fructose as well as sorbitol) effected an increase in blood glucose concentration and in serum insulin concentration.	It is concluded that the increase in blood glucose concentration causes the increase in serum insulin concentration.	Therefore, glucose utilization is decreased despite an increase in serum insulin.	However, in many cases glucose can be administered only if insulin is given additionally.	Efficacy of and indications for the use of purer forms of insulin have now been established, and arguments showing the relation of blood glucose control to the development and progression of complications have been strengthened.	Plasma levels of thyrotropin (TSH), prolactin (Prl), growth hormone (GH), thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3) were measured in response to continuous 24-h infusion of synthetic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in normal and surgically thyroidectomized (THYX) calves in a series of 2 experiments.	Corrective therapy consisted of rapid fluid, electrolyte, bicarbonate, and glucose replacement with insulin supplementation.	Different concentrations of rabbit gamma globulin, bovine serum albumin, soybean trypsin inhibitor and bovine ribonuclease were used as antigens and some properties of such immunoadsorbents were studied.	Although no relation was observed between platelet count and transferrin saturation, it was correlated with serum iron values.	less than the glucose content of maternal plasma and there is no evidence that this relation is influenced by the fetal or maternal insulin level.	The night- and daytime basal plasma insulin levels and insulin responses to an intravenous glucose load, basal blood glucose levels and rates of glucose uptake, and, finally, the diurnal patterns of blood glucose levels were investigated in normal compared to vagotomized Wistar rats.	Insulin resistance, which develops in sepsis, decreases glucose utilization, but plasma insulin levels are sufficiently elevated to prevent lipolysis, resulting in a further energy deficit.	Blood samples were drawn from fifteen patients in whom the diagnosis of sepsis was clinically established; the samples were analyzed for amino acid, beta-hydroxyphenylethanolamines, glucose, insulin and glucagon concentrations.	The outcome of patients with sepsis might be positively affected by combined therapy with glucose, insulin and branched chain amino acids.	In three tests of dopaminergic antagonism--elevation of levels of CSF homovanillic acid in monkeys, striatal dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in rats, and prolactin in man--as well as in a clinical trial of neuroleptic efficacy in schizophrenics, thiethylperazine was fully active and approximately three times as potent as chlorpromazine.	The effects of 50 microgram synthetic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) intravenously on thyrotropin (TSH), prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) levels were studied in 8 normal male newborns during the first hours of life.	These results indicate that the abnormal turnover of labelled plasminogen and prothrombin in cirrhosis of the liver is due to two mechanisms; increased breakdown, reversible by heparin administration, and impaired synthesis.	Plasma levels of zinc and albumin have been measured for eight consecutive days in patients suffering chest pain due to myocardial infarction or myocardial ischaemia.	The fall in plasma zinc is not totally explained by the fall in plasma albumin.	When the rats received a high lactose diet, the lactase of the jejunum is more active because of both the intestinal tissue development and a higher production of enzyme by protein unit.	The flora of the animal which has not consumed lactose since weaning can develop a noticeable lactase activity after 7 hr of incubation in presence of lactose.	Primary cultures of mammary cells from virgin Lewis rats were seeded at 5 X 10(5) cells per cm2 in medium 199 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, insulin (5 microgram/ml), prolactin (5 microgram/ml), estradiol (5 ng/ml), progesterone (0.5 microgram/ml), and hydrocortisone (0.5 microgram/ml).	The hyperglycemic activities of epinephrine (EPI) and isoproterenol (ISO) in baboons correlated with their ability to increase plasma glucagon (IRG) levels relative to insulin (IRI).	Oral glucose tolerance tests indicated that the lactase activity was rate limiting for lactose absorption postoperatively.	Enzymes production by the tested isolates increased as the culture age increased; except in case of catalase enzyme, the reverse action was detected.	These pure catalases induced, after injecting into guinea-pigs, anti-serums that react specifically with catalase and does not give any cross reaction with peroxidases and haemic iron containing compounds.	Plasma insulin concentration was low and norepinephrine and glucagon concentrations were elevated in the postexercise period.	The finding that rapid glycogen synthesis occurred despite a hormonal milieu conducive to glycogenolysis provides evidence that a low glycogen concentration is a potent stimulus to glycogen synthesis that overrides the effects of low insulin, and high norepinephrine and glucagon levels.	These metabolic changes induced by the glucose load were not mediated by endogenous insulin because they were observed to the same extent in rats treated with anti-insulin serum.	Trypsin digestion of human serum transferrin partially saturated with iron(III)-nitrilotriacetate at pH 5.5 or pH 8.5 produces a carbohydrate-containing iron-binding fragment of mol.wt.	The distribution of iron in human serum transferrin partially saturated with various iron donors was examined by electrophoresis in urea/polyacrylamide gels and the two possible monoferric forms were unequivocally identified.	The distribution of iron on transferrin in human plasma was determined.	Upon further investigation we discovered that the activity resided in a low-molecular-weight fraction of the rat prolactin B-1 preparation and was probably either vasopressin or oxytocin or both.	In group II, both intestinal absorption and urinary excretion of calcium fell significantly after recovery of satisfactory metabolic control by insulin therapy.	The effects of duodenal instillation of sodium oleate (10 mmoles per hr) on plasma levels of gastrin and secretin and on gastric acid secretion in response to gastric and intestinal meals were determined.	These results show that fat in the duodenum is a potent inhibitor of gastrin release and gastric acid secretion; the intestinal mechanism involved does not appear to affect plasma secretin concentrations.	Low lactase levels developed during childhood in all races studied, however, many for unknown reasons maintained their lactose tolerance until adulthood.	The effects of PGF2alpha infusion in a dose of 25 micrograms/min for 5 hours on serum levels of estradiol-17beta, progesterone, LH, FSH, TSH and prolactin, and on the pituitary hormone responsiveness to LRH and TRH were studied in 10 apparently healthy cycling women in the mid-luteal phase.	No change in serum glucose or insulin levels following TRH infusion was observed.	Two of the three also reacted in albumin at 37 C, and one of these was moderately enhanced by papain.	Iron transferrin preincubated with rat bone marrow cells donates less iron to rat bone marrow cells, Chinese hamster fibroblasts, human fibroblasts and human lymphoblasts than freshly prepared iron transferrin equal in iron and transferrin concentraion.	Rat liver parenchymal cells, however, take up more iron from preincubated than from freshly prepared iron transferrin.	From experiments with iron transferrin mixtures in which radioiron was present at low or high iron saturation, it could be concluded that rat bone marrow cells take up iron equally well from monoferric as from diferric transferrin.	The influence of intravenously administered tolbutamide, glibenclamide, HB 699, and glucose on serum insulin and blood glucose kinetics was examined in 36 enterectomized dogs.	The inhibitory action of coumarin on tumour incidence and multiplicity showed a dose-related association with elevated serum prolactin and reduced hepatic drug metabolism.	There was no significant difference between serum insulin concentrations on the two doses, however, serum insulin/blood glucose ratio was higher during the larger dose of glibenclamide.	In the individual patient the changes in blood glycerol and plasma non-esterified fatty acids were related to changes in circulating insulin concentration and did not appear to be a true extra-pancreatic effect of glibenclamide.	Electroimmunodiffusion on a cellulose acetate support medium was used to study the effect of heat treatment on the antigenic activity of bovine serum albumin suspended in water, simulated milk ultrafiltrate (J & K buffer), or saline (.85%) and of bovine serum albumin in milk per se.	Gestamimetic amounts of progesterone enhance basal and glucose-stimulated insulin production.	The enzyme activities responded as expected to stimuli such as insulin and glucose, which depressed phosphorylase and increased synthase activity, and glucagon, which increased phosphorylase and decreased synthase activity.	Standard and constant rates of insulin and dextrose infusion resulted in satisfactory control of blood glucose concentrations during labour, after major surgery, and in patients recovering from ketoacidosis (average insulin infusion rates 1, 2, and 3 U/h respectively).	Mean steady state plasma-free insulin levels achieved were 28.6--49 mu/1 in patients receiving 2 u/h but a satisfactory rate of fall of glucose was not always obtained until the infusion dose was increased to 4 u/h or more.	Plasma renin activity, but not plasma aldosterone correlated with the fluid and sodium retention over the initial 24 h treatment period, but not with potassium requirements.	An infusion rate of at least 4 U. per hour produced satisfactory rate of fall of plasma glucose, whereas lower dose regimens (2 U. per hour)--producing steady state free insulin concentrations ranging from 28 to 49 mU.	Explants of 1 cm2 in size were placed in tissue-culture dishes to which was added 2 ml of CMRL-1066 medium supplemented with glucose, hydrocortisone, beta-retinyl acetate, and either 2.5% bovine albumin or 5% fetal bovine serum.	The degree of ipsilateral innervation generally correlates with the degree of pigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium and with tyrosinase activity.	There were no differences among the three groups in hematocrit, fasting serum iron or transferrin saturation, severity of malnutrition, or evidence of other malabsorption sufficient to explain these differences.	Although hematocrits, fasting serum iron, and transferrin saturations did not change appreciably during nutritional rehabilitation, all children with initially abnormal responses subsequently had normal tests.	Specific antibody against 2'-(5"-phosphoribosyl)-5'AMP (PR-AMP), a monomer of poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) (poly(ADP-Rib)), was produced by immunizing a rabbit with PR-AMP coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA).	The use of estrogens led to increase of the serum prolactin level.	The data obtained in this study suggest a possible direct relationship between the initial urea levels and the total amount of insulin needed to reduce the initial glycemia to a normal glycemic level.	Clinical findings included low zinc plasma levels, skin lesions and loss of all the advantages of TPN such as weight gain, serum proteins and albumin increase and normalization of intestinal mucosa.	Comparisons were performed between serum concentrations of thyroxine (T4), thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), prealbumin (TBPA) and albumin (Alb) in capillary versus peripheral vein, aorta versus central vein and, finally, in peripheral versus central veins.	When albumin fractions of chimpanzees were polymerized with glutaraldehyde, they also bound with the receptor on hepatitis B surface antigen.	Plasma growth hormone (GH) concentrations in Parkinsonian patients following 3 months optimum therapy with bromocriptine showed no significant change from pretreatment values, whilst plasma prolactin concentrations were uniformly suppressed.	Supplementation of 150 microgram of chromium per day reversed the glucose intolerance, reduced insulin requirements, and resulted in weight gain and the disappearance of encephalopathy.	Chromium (III) has recently been shown to be an essential trace mineral in rats, being required for normal function of insulin in controlling glucose metabolism.	Chromium is transported in the body bound to transferrin, where it binds competitively with iron.	Hemochromatosis is an iron storage disease in humans characterized by highly saturated transferrin levels and sometimes by diabetes.	Mutants that are deficient in adenine deaminase (puuA), guanine deaminase (puuB), xanthine dehydrogenase (puuC), uricase (puuD), allantoinase (puuE), and/or allantoicase (puuF) were isolated and used for the genetic study.	Daily serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, estradiol-17beta, and progesterone were measured by radioimmunoassay for 1 month.	In an attempt to determine whether the central control of prolactin (PRL) release is altered in the SHR we have compared the PRL response to immobilization stress, thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH), haloperidol, and L-DOPA in the SHR and in normotensive Wistar control rats.	Thirteen patients with abnormal oral lactose tolerance tests were identified as having a primary low lactase activity on the basis of elevated sucrase/lactase ratios.	In each patient, gastrin decreased in conjunction with the fall in plasma calcium, and increased during calcium infusion.	Plasma gastrin and calcium levels were strongly correlated.	At a concentration of 1 microg Au/ml (5 microM), auranofin produced a marked reduction in beta-glucuronidase (100%), acid phosphatase (88%), and lysozyme (72%) release.	In both groups, a significant and equal fall in both serum glucose and glucagon concentrations was observed.	Plasma phosphate, glucose, and free insulin concentrations were measured sequentially during the 60 min infusion periods.	Insulinemia is not the only reason for the tendency to hypoglycemia shown by these patients, which seems rather to be due to the lack of pancreatic glucagon, which is not available to antagonize the inhibition of glucose release from the liver by insulin (and also in alcohol abuse).	At therapeutic rates (0.5 g/kg body weight/h) in the postoperative period they produce hyperglycaemia and an insulin response, not previously evident and similar to that of glucose.	A study was made of the effect of administration of maninyl (glybenclamide) into the stomach in a dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight for 7 days on the blood glucose level, insulin and zinc content in the pancreatic islands, and on the "dithizone" diabetes development.	The amount of deposited insulin and zinc determined histochemically was sharply reduced up to complete disappearance from the majority of beta-cells.	A modified method of Cavill for the separation of the complex of isotopically labelled iron and transferrin from unbound iron residues is described.	These lesions resulted in the cessation of LH and FSH secretion and blocked the positive feedback action of estradiol on gonadotropin release but did not appear to influence grossly basal thyroid and adrenocortical function, or to abolish GH discharge in response to insulin hypoglycemia.	The previously reported synchronous oscillations in plasma glucose and insulin levels have been further studied to determine whether the phenomenon can be attributed to cyclic secretion or degradation of the hormone.	The glycaemic and insulinaemic response to oral glucose was measured at baseline, after 1 week and at 3 months, and the results related to adipocyte insulin receptors estimated from fat biopsies taken on each occasion and to the weight lost.	Adipocyte insulin binding was found to be significantly inversely correlated with the insulinaemic response to oral glucose (r = -0.54, P less than 0.05), an inverse relationship maintained even after weight loss had been achieved and displayed within as well as between subjects.	Serum prolactin levels were measured in 50 patients with oligospermia and in 20 control subjects under fasting conditions and following the administration of levodopa, pyridoxine, metoclopramide, and synthetic thyrotropin-releasing hormone.	Changes in the serum levels of retinol-binding protein, prealbumin and transferrin were registered as well as changes in total protein and nitrogen balance up to a maximum of 10 postoperative days.	Depending upon the amount of administered amino acids, the values for transferrin and nitrogen balance had changed more significantly than those of serum concentrations of retinol-binding protein and of prealbumin.	Previous studies had shown that ciclazindol increased glucose uptake into isolated human skeletal muscle independently of insulin.	The application of glucocorticoids, glucagon, heparin in small doses and of a carboanhydrase inhibitor [Diamox] is rejected by most of the departments.	The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of glibenclamide on the insulin receptors, the insulin sensitivity and the insulin secretion in obese non-ketotic diabetics.	In the group treated with glibenclamide and diet the insulin secretory pattern was unchanged, too (p greater than 0.1).	In 4 patients who were treated with diet (1200 kcal/day) plus glibenclamide and in 5 patients who were treated with diet alone (1200 kcal/day) the insulin binding to monocytes was studied during treatment for 1 year.	After 1 year we found a significantly (P less than 0.005) higher cellular insulin binding in the glibenclamide treated patients compared to the patients who got diet alone.	We conclude that 1) the augmentation of the insulin sensitivity is of great importance for the normalization of the diabetic state in obese, 2) the increase in insulin binding may be of importance for the increase in insulin sensitivity, 3) glibenclamide appears to enhance the insulin sensitivity through an increase in the number of insulin receptors.	It inhibited bovine and rat trypsin, showed weak inhibition of bovine chymotrypsin and was inactive against rat chymotrypsin and bovine renin, kallikrein, thrombin and trypsinogen.	The enzymatic oxidation of E-3,4-bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-hex-3-ene (diethylstilbestrol) by either mushroom tyrosinase or rat liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH and air yields a catechol.	Acute administration of lisuride (100 microgram orally) significantly suppressed serum prolactin (PRL) levels in nine out of eleven subjects.	Following implantation, a decrease of plasma glucose from the initial value of 500 mg/dl to normoglycaemia and a corresponding increase in circulating levels of insulin up to 100 muU/ml were observed in the recipient animals.	Furthermore the IAEPs were shown to produce a near normal plasma glucose and insulin response to an intravenous glucose tolerance test.	Antisera from rabbits injected with rat adipocyte plasma membranes or intrinsic proteins from such membranes, obtained by a dimethylmaleic anhydride extraction step, mimicked the action of insulin on both glucose transport and lipolysis in intact adipocytes.	By cytochemistry (acid phosphatase and tyrosinase activities) GERL, a specialized hydrolase-rich region of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), can be visualized in the cells of the mouse retinal pigment epithelium.	5% glucose solution and insulin in small doses less than 5 U/h; in predominantly hyperglycemic hyperosmolarity, weak alkaline isotonic electrolytic solutions (309 mOsm/l) and insulin in medium doses (6--8 U/h); in exclusively hyperglycemic hyperosmolarity, hypertonic electrolytic solutions (395 mOsm/l) associated with sufficient insulin dosis (8--12 U/h).	Postoperative lactose intolerance is due to the loss of pyloric function, causing entrance of lactose into the jejunum at a rate exceeding the hydrolytic capacity of the mucosa if the lactase level is low.	Those in group I demonstrated suppressed plasma renin activity, baseline and after furosemide, and blunted aldosterone responsiveness to furosemide.	Hence, secretin displays specific properties, by arresting only the action of gastrin on the gastric glands.	The following results were obtained: (1) plasma concentrations of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) increased proportionally to the dose of infused insulin, but the higher IRI did not result in a greater fall in plasma glucose concentration, correspondingly; the mean rate of fall in plasma glucose concentration of 5 x B was not significantly lower than that of 50 x B; beta-hydroxybutyrate and arterial pH improvements were observed in each group during the 3-h insulin infusion.	These data suggested that for the improvement of diabetic ketoacidosis, the insulin infusion rate of more than 30 x B, which raised the plasma IRI levels above the physiological range, was not essential; (2) the necessity of potassium supplementation during the small-dose insulin infusion was suggested if the pre-treatment level of serum potassium was low.	The hyperglycemia frequently resolved more rapidly than the systemic acidosis; this was managed by adding glucose to the intravenous fluids when the blood sugar concentration decreased to approximately 250 mg/dL; insulin infusion, however, was continued until the acidosis was corrected (venous standard bicarbonate greater than 14 mEq/L).	Nor did pinealectomy affect hypothalamic TRH content, pituitary content of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or prolactin; serum levels of (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), or thyroxine (T4), or serum free-thyroxine index; or free-triiodothyronine index.	In immature human placentas, the activity of the I (glucose-6-phosphate-independent) form of glycogen synthase is significantly increased by insulin, glucose and by both compounds associated.	A single injection of cortisone or thyroxine to 8-day-old suckling mice initiates a temporary decrease of lactase activity.	On the contrary, 3 injections of cortisone or thyroxine provoke a significant increase of lactase activity.	FSH, LH and prolactin (PRL) in pituitary tissues and FSH, LH, PRL, estradiol (E2) and progesterone (PRG) in plasma were determined during pregnancy (1,2 and 3-week), at paturition (0 to 12 hours after parturition) and during lactation (1,2,3,4,5 and 6-week).	The changes in the A0.5 produced by incubations with insulin or epinephrine were mutually reversible.	We now present evidence that these fluctuations result from adaptations intrinsic to adipose tissue glycogen metabolism that persist in vitro: in response to insulin (1 milliunit/ml), [3H]glucose incorporation into rat fat pad glycogen was reduced to 10% of control after a 3-day fast; incorporation increased 6-fold over fed control on the 4th day of refeeding following a 3-day fast.	In addition, we found that incubation of fat pads from fasted rats with insulin (1 milliunit/ml) increased glucose-6-P content, indicating that glucose transport was not the rate-limiting step for glucose incorporation into glycogen in the presence of insulin.	In contrast, feeding a fat-free diet resulted in dramatic increases in glycogen content of fat pads without a concomitant increase in glucose incorporation into glycogen in response to insulin (1 milliunit/ml).	Under dissociating conditions (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel electrophoresis in the presence of 6 M urea), part of the purified enzyme dissociated into two smaller fragments (Mr = 20,000 and 25,000) containing renin activity.	Although many problems are still to be solved, there are examples that point to a possible later application for the benefit of mankind: Bacteria can be manipulated to degrade crude-oil spillages, to produce human insulin and to bind nitrogen from the air.	Serum concentrations of thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), prealbumin (TBPA) and albumin (Alb) were determined in 492 blood samples from 127 fullterm (FT), 91 small-for-gestational age (SGA) and 88 preterm (PT) healthy infants aged 7 to 240 days.	Sequential measurements of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), serum haptoglobin (Hp), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were made in 209 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); 78 of them were treated with gold, 71 with dapsone, and 60 with prednisone.	The effects of divalent cations, in particular Ca2+ and Mg2+, on glucose uptake by rat isolated fat cells in the presence and absence of insulin have been studied.	The removal of Ca2+ and Mg2+ from the incubation medium did not affect the basal glucose uptake, but abolished the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake by the cells.	Several parameters such as total body-weight, blood sugar levels, insulin i.s., glucose-tolerance and glucose-assimilation tests demonstrated that the islets still retained their normal function despite the isolation procedure.	When explants of tissue from adult hypothyroid virgin animals are cultured in serum-free medium containing insulin, hydrocortisone, and PRL, the specific milk protein, alpha-lactalbumin, is induced.	The plasma TSH response to propylthiouracil (PTU) in TRH-bovine serum albumin (BSA)-immunized rats was significantly lower than that of BSA-immunized or non-immunized rats.	A quantitative study of the transformation of ethanol into acetaldehyde shows that, in Drosophila melanogaster, the mitochondrial ethanol oxidizing system is not very active but that the part played by catalase appears more important than expected.	Antiserum against glibenclamide was obtained from rabbits immunized with an antigen prepared by conjugating the diazonium salt of N(p-amino-benzamidoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl-N'-cyclohexylurea to bovine serum albumin through the diazocoupling.	The results suggest that cell membrane associated calcium may be involved in exocytosis, and by its sudden increase may trigger the first phase of insulin secretion.	The calcium stores in the cytoplasm and the granules may be of importance for long-term regulation of insulin release.	A chromium 51-labeled albumin stool collection of greater than 1% in 5 of 7 patients at the completion of a HPN course correlated with relapse within 4 mo.	In PCB-treated rats, thiamine levels in blood, liver and sciatic nerve decreased, transketolase activity in erythrocytes and liver decreased and TPP effect in erythrocytes and liver increased.	In DDT-treated rats, thiamine levels in blood, brain and liver decreased, transketolase activity in brain and liver decreased and TPP effect in brain and liver increased.	Hypertonic glucose (gradually increased from 20-40%), covered with insulin in the early phase, is used as source of carbohydrates.	Intravenous administration of metaclopramide and cimetidine provokes an immediate rise in serum prolactin concentration.	Eight months after transplantation, the plasma insulin and glucose responses to OGTT were still unchanged while those of the less physiological IPGTT were worse.	The effect of iron deprivation on growth of 101 aerobic strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was studied on agar media in the presence of various concentrations of the synthetic iron chelator ethylene diamine diorthohydroxyphenyl acetic acid (EDDA) and the iron binding protein transferrin.	Lactase and maltase, the predominant sugar hydrolases associated with the intestinal brush bordermembrane of the suckling rat, were purified essentially free of the other to near homogeneity (lactase at specific activity 23, maltase at specific activity 58), and their specific physiocochemical properties determined.	The influence of sensitization to horse serum, brucelia and BCG, and the allergic reactions induced by these antigens, on the oxygen tension and myoglobin content in the muscle tissues was studied.	The effects of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), glucagon, and secretin on lower esophageal sphincter pressure were investigated in awake baboons.	VIP was shown to reduce resting and pentagastrin-stimulated lower esophageal sphincter pressure with significantly greater potency than either secretin or glucagon.	For reduction of resting lower esophageal sphincter pressure, the potency ratio of VIP to secretin was 16:1 and of VIP to glucagon was 32:1 (P less than 0.05).	For inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated sphincter pressure, the potency ratio of VIP to secretin was 32:1 and of VIP to glucagon was 64:1 (P less than 0.02).	This in vivo study assessed the immediate effects of insulin on glucose and ketone body utilization in the fed, fasted, and diabetic ketoacidotic rat.	This surgical procedure permitted the assessment of the effect of exogenously administered insulin on the rate of both glucose and ketone body utilization by peripheral tissues.	The autolytic enzyme activity released from intact cells, or cell walls, was predominantly in the later (proteinase activable) form which could be activated by trypsin or a proteinase present in commerical bovine plasma albumin.	The achieved levels of plasma insulin satisfy the transport of glucose and the inhibition of lipolysis.	Calcium, inorganic phosphorous, albumin, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, alkaline phosphatase and potassium were high in colony-bred animals.	The analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid gave the following information: Case 1: 1,500 cells, 80 percent of which were polynuclear neutrophils; Pandy's reaction was positive; albumin 1.5 g/l and glucose 0.65 g/l.	Case 2: 197 cells/mm3, 90 percent of which were polynuclear neutrophils; Pandy's reaction was positive; albumin and glucose were 0.60 and 0.10 g/l respectively.	These facts together with the absence of inhibition by simple pretreatment of DNA alone as well as the cell protection by protamine against lytic activity of lysozyme, suggest a protamine-cell surface interaction which impedes DNA uptake events.	The existence of a functionally immature fetal albumin has been postulated to explain the reduced ability of newborn plasma to bind bilirubin and various drugs.	Binding studies with bilirubin showed association constants of 3.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(7) M(-1) for cord and 2.9 +/- 0.3 x 10(7) M(-1) for adult albumin, respectively.	Extracts were tested for inhibitory capacity against purified human uterine tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase and plasmin of fibrin plates prepared from different grades of fibrinogen and fibrin.	Nevertheless, some differences were found which indicated the possible existence of separate urokinase and tissue activator inhibitors or of different inhibition mechanisms for these plasminogen activators.	It is suggested that dopamine and TRH may interact to modulate pituitary secretion of both TSH and prolactin, though the hypophyseal thyrotrophs and lactotrophs show a different sensitivity to the common stimulatory and inhibitory substances.	The effect of two second generation sulphonylureas, gliquidone and glibenclamide, on insulin secretion has been studied in the basal state and in combination with glucose infusions in normal controls, patients with mild maturity-onset diabetes, and subjects with normal glucose tolerance but low insulin response.	When injected intravenously, gliquidone caused rapid elevation of plasma insulin, peaking at 5 min in all groups, while glibenclamide induced a slow rise in insulin.	In all groups, 25 micrograms/kg glibenclamide and 200 micrograms/kg gliquidone were equipotent in generating an insulin response at the basal state.	The glucose-insulin dose relationships, established by giving glucose alone, demonstrated curves that were flatter, and shifted to the right of the control in diabetics and low insulin responders, the changes being more marked in the former group.	Addition of sulphonylurea induced a left shift in the dose-response relationships in controls and low insulin responders; under these conditions the effect of glibenclamide was more pronounced than that of gliquidone.	In the group of mild diabetics, insulin response to glucose was enhanced by sulphonylureas only to a modest extent, the dose-response curves remaining grossly abnormal.	Kinetic studies indicate that ethanol depressed the Vmax and increased the Km of sucrase and lactase.	The D50s for octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-OP) and acetylcholine were around 10(-12) M and 10(-11) M, respectively.	Serum glucagon concentrations averaged 320 pg/ml and were not depressed by glucose intake.	The binding specificities of human urinary urokinase (EC 3.4.99.26) and HeLa cell plasminogen activator were studied using peptidyl chloromethyl ketone inhibitors.	The susceptibility of the HeLa cell plasminogen activator differed from that of urokinase in several respects indicating the utility of this type of inhibitor in distinguishing between proteases of this specificity.	The present paper describes a new test using normal isolated pancreatic cells as target cells and evaluating the effect of activated or non-activated macrophages on the insulin secretion response to glucose stimulation.	A potentiometric technique allowed us to observe and measure a photopotential of rhodopsin containing vesicles obtained from retinal disc membranes.	Earlier studies on decapitated fetuses established that glycogen storage in the liver is dependent on a dual hormonal control, comprising a pituitary hormone like growth hormone or prolactin (some placental hormones share the same activity) and corticosteroids (Jost, 1961).	Glucose administered at a rate of 3 to 4 g er unit of insulin infused in the low-dose group maintained a serum glucose of 150 to 250 mg/dl.	Cortisol and prolactin concentrations tend to be higher in subordinate monkeys while only the dominant male shows elevated testosterone levels during group interactions with attractive females.	To investigate the role of endogenous insulin on the secretion of immunoreactive gastric inhibitory polypeptide (IR-GIP) the response of IR-GIP and immunoreactive insulin (IRI) to an oral fat load (100 g triglyceride) alone and during an intravenous glucose infusion (0.7 g/kg/h) was examined in normal weight and obese subjects.	Thus, a graded abnormality of the GIP response to glucose induced insulin release occurs in obesity with normal and pathological glucose tolerance.	Serum gastrin increased in patients with pernicious anaemia after a beef-meal, but decreased after an oral load of glucose, xylose or sodium chloride.	50 g of glucose and 25 or 75 g of xylose suppressed serum gastrin to approximately 40% of basal values at 60 min and were slightly more effective than 10 g of sodium chloride.	Nasal administration of small amounts of vasopressin decreased basal serum gastrin significantly in six vagotomized patients.	Nasal administration of small amounts of vasopressin decreased basal serum gastrin significantly in all subjects examined.	It is concluded that the inhibitory effect of glucose on gastrin secretion most likely is mediated hormonally via osmo-receptors located in the small intestine.	Islet transplantation in the diabetic rat returns plasma glucose and insulin levels to normal.	Glibenclamide, a "second generation" sulfonylurea, produced the same pattern of insulin release from the perfused rat pancreas as did tolbutamide.	Both agents enhanced insulin secretion at 5--10 mM glucose, whereas no additional insulin was released when maximally stimulating levels of glucose (20 and 30 mM) were present.	The concentrations of glibenclamide stimulating insulin release were 100--400 times lower than equieffective levels of tolbutamide.	At glucose levels of 3 or 8 mM, however, glibenclamide did not liberate significantly more insulin from the pancreas than did tolbutamide.	Elevation of the plasma insulin level was obtained by vagal stimulation or intravenous glucose administration and vagal stimulation, whereas increased glucagon levels were induced by sympathetic stimulation, increased plasma insulin levels, with simultaneous increased plasma glucose concentrations (in our experiments with sheep), produced a pronounced lowering of the FFA levels.	However, in the primate experiments, increased plasma insulin without concomitant glucose administration caused an elevation of FFA levels, and would indicate a lipolytic rather than a lipogenetic action of insulin.	The degree of autonomy in prolactin secreting pituitary adenomas and also prolactin secretory reserve in cases with suspected functional galactorrhea syndrome was evaluated with the use of metoclopramide, TRH and L-DOPA.	It was found that in patients with pituitary adenoma the basal prolactin (PRL) level often exceeded 150 micrograms/l and the response to stimulation with TRH and/or metoclopramide was markedly diminished or even nonexistent, while the response to L-DOPA was usually retained.	We assayed serum prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), L-triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4).	T3 therapy (100 microgram/day) decreased the thyroidal radioactive iodine uptake to less than half the baseline prolactin was normal with a normal response to methyl-TRH to 4.1 micronU/ml.	Plasma prolactin and TSH responses to TRH were decreased following bromocriptine pretreatment.	These results suggest a dopaminergic influence on prolactin and TSH release in normal men, an inhibitory effect of TRH on bromocriptine stimulated growth hormone secretion, and no dopaminergic modulation of basal insulin secretion.	An elevation of serum prolactin was noted in heroin addicts, while ex-addicts had normal levels.	Aiming to appreciate the frequence and the intensivity of the endocrine effects of lithium, the thyroid parameters and the steady state of the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis were tested using the TRH test in 52 patients with maniaco-depressive psychosis with special attention to TSH, prolactin and growth hormone: 24 out of them were treated for 1 month to 6 years by lithium; the 28 others were considered as controls.	Changes in plasma glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, insulin, glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone, and prolactin have been studied in baboons during the course of generalized epileptic seizures induced by intravenous bicuculline.	Peak lactase values in fetuses receiving lactose were substantially higher than peak values in control fetuses.	Activities of alkaline phosphatase (1526 U/l), glutamine oxaloacetate transaminase (30.9 U/l), glutamine pyruvate transaminase (13.7 U/l), lactate dehydrogenase (629 U/l), alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (175 U/l), creatine phosphokinase (227 U/l), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (38.7 U/l) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (14.2 U/l), and levels of lysozyme (178 mg/dl), zinc (162 microgram/dl), copper (81.3 microgram/dl) and iron (296.5 microgram/dl) have not previously been reported for this animal.	Postoperatively, blood glucose levels did not require insulin.	Antiserum to purified plasminogen activator, prepared from porcine ovaries, inhibited the activity of the human uterine extracts, but not the activities of human urokinase or urine.	Each of 8 diabetic dogs was given daily 8-16 IU of insulin, 250-750 mg carbutamide or 2-10 mg glibenclamide, respectively; doses were always adjusted to the actual metabolic requirements and findings were compared to those of 11 untreated diabetic and 6 healthy dogs.	A significant correlation was found between basal plasma catecholamines and initial plasma glucose, plasma bicarbonate, hours of therapy and insulin dosage required to obtain plasma glucose levels below 150 mg/100 ml .These results, suggesting a close correlation between glycometabolic control and adrenergic activity, emphasize the role of the sympathetic nervous system as a powerful contrainsular factor in the pathogenesis and metabolic derangement of diabetic ketoacidosis.	Luteolysis and subsequent parturition also occurred in pregnant goats in mid and late gestation after PGF2 alpha injection, with an associated release of prolactin and decrease in plasma progesterone.	Acute prolactin release in response to injection of thyrotrophin releasing factor may have had a transient effect on plasma progesterone levels, but did not appear to be luteolytic in either pregnant or non-pregnant goats.	Hepatocytes from starved rats or fed rats whose glycogen content was previously depleted by phlorrhizin or by glucagon injections, form glycogen at rapid rates when incubated with 10mM-glucose, gluconeogenic precursors (lactate, glycerol, fructose etc.)	Serum lipid, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins and plasma insulin and glucose were studied in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) fed high sucrose diets (69%, w/w), with and without added cholesterol.	Dietary sucrose increased the plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin-glucose ratios.	The addition of cholesterol also tended to decrease plasma glucose and insulin levels.	Bovine rod outer segments (rods), isolated with an intact plasma membrane and a stable calcium exchange and storage capacity, contain 2-3 mol endogenous calcium/mol rhodopsin.	The Scatchard plot of calcium binding of rods indicates the presence of a single set of intradiskal binding sites with a maximal capacity of 8-9 mol calcium/mol rhodopsin and an affinity constant of 55 microM to calcium.	The changes of insulin, blood sugars, lactate and free fatty acid levels were studied in 12 newborns of diabetic mothers and in 21 newborns of healthy mothers in the course of intravenous infusions of glucose and galactose at a dose of 0.5 g.kg-1.h-1.	During glucose infusion a striking increase of insulin levels took place, which was higher in the infants of diabetic mothers.	An enzyme thermistor filled with coimmobilized glucose oxidase and catalase was used to measure the amount of glucose in the outflow from a column reactor containing immobilized lactase acting on a lactose solution pumped through the reactor.	The overall dynamics of insulin release by the foetal islets in response to glucose 13.9 mM is biphasic and qualitatively similar to that obtained with islets of adult Rats.	after the increase of glucose concentration in the medium and a maximum insulin release for the first phase is obtained with a lag period of 2 min.	Patterns of prolactin (PRL) secretion were studied in a group of 18 hyperprolactinaemic patients with galactorrhoea and menstrual disorders and in a control group of thirty-two women in the early puerperium (24 h after a normal delivery) following provocative (TRH and Chlorpromazine) and suppressive (L-Dopa and bromocriptine) stimuli.	Reliable and specific radioimmunoassays have been developed for the gut hormones secretin, gastrin, cholecystokinin, pancreatic glucagon, VIP, GIP, motilin, and enteroglucagon.	VIP occurred in high concentration in all regions of the bowel, whereas secretin, GIP, motilin, and CCK were predominantly localised in the proximal small intestine.	The acid ethanol extraction method that was used was found to be unsuitable for gastrin.	In 26 adult patients of an intensive-care ward, the following parameters were controlled for 26 to 35 days under postoperative parenteral feeding: prealbumin, transferrin, and retinol-binding protein, the immunoglobulins IgA, IgM and IgG, total serum protein, Hb content, body-weight and urinary nitrogen elimination.	The addition of insulin, or insulin plus hydrocortisone or insulin plus hydrocortisone plus triiodothyronine, was important for the maintenance of protein synthesis and essential for maximal expression of the ability of steroids to induce porphyrins and ALA-synthase in the "permissive" effect which insulin, hydrocortisone, and triiodothyronine exert on allylisopropylacetamide induction of porphyrins and ALA-synthase also extends to the induction process which is elicited by natural steroids.	The present investigation deals with the comparison between the thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) effect on prolactin and thyrotropin when the hormone was administered intravenously at doses of 50, 100 and 200 microgram respectively to three groups of six men (aged 22 to 30 years), before and on the sixth day of indomethacin administration (50 mg orally at 6-hour intervals).	No significant change in the releasing hormone effect was observed either in the case of prolactin, where TRH caused a consistently similar release of the hormone at every dose employed, or in the case of thyrotropin, where a dose-dependent releasing effect was obtained before and after indomethacin treatment.	The effect of insulin requires a previous exposure of the fetal liver to glucocorticoids.	Formalin fixed brains of various ages of rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) were sunk in 10% phosphate buffered formalin which contained 30% sucrose, and then embedded in a 3% gelatin, 30% egg albumin solution which had been centrifuged to ensure uniformity.	Fullday profiles of blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide and sulfonylurea level in serum were made on the third day under each preparation.	In order to investigate the effect of cyproheptadine, a compound with antiserotoninergic activity, on the secretion of thyrotrophin (TSH) and prolactin (PRL), the nocturnal secretory patterns of these hormones have been studied in 4 normal men in the basal state and after an oral treatment with the drug.	Specific abnormalities in glucose utilization that appear to be related to alterations in membrane receptors, resulting in increased glucagon sensitivity and decreased insulin action, are a newly recognized factor in intolerance to oral glucose.	Its concentration in plasma as well as that of prolactin (PRL), thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) were measured following either intravenous or oral administration of TRH.	Hyperprolactenemia induced by acute and chronic treatment with chlorpromazine showed significantly higher prolactin levels in seminal plasma on 8th and 16th day respectively, by which time the serum prolactin levels have already reached pretreatment levels.	Motilin, substance P, bombesin, neurotensin, and thyrotropin releasing hormone had potent depolarizing actions on dorsal root terminals and motoneurons.	Adrenocorticotrophic hormone, secretin, and pancreozymin (cholecystokinin) also depolarized dorsal root terminals and motoneurons.	The effects of secretin and cholecystokinin were not abolished by tetrodotoxin.	Gastrin, gastric inhibitory peptide, glucagon, and somatostatin had no apparent effects on the responses of the preparation.	The possibility that this effect is of importance in its hypoglycaemic action was investigated by studying the effect of galactose on insulin release before and after treatment with glibenclamide; galactose stimulates insulin release when given orally but has no effect when given parenterally; thus its ability to release insulin appears to reside in an action on a gut factor.	Measurements of plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon were made on twelve maturity onset diabetic patients following an oral glucose tolerance test and an oral galactose tolerance test before and after one week of treatment with glibenclamide.	The insulin response to oral glucose was enhanced.	An effect of glibenclamide on gut insulin releasing activity was not demonstrated but the galactose tolerance test provides a useful technique by which to examine the enteroinsular axis.	The in vitro plasma clot technique was employed to examine the role of calcium during the interaction of erythropoietin and mouse erythroid progenitor cells.	Marrow cells incubated first in calcium-free medium with erythropoietin and then cultured in the presence of calcium but not erythropoietin, failed to form erythroid colonies although colony formation occurred when erythropoietin was provided.	Taken together, the data indicate that calcium is required for both extracellular and intracellular events during the interaction of erythropoietin with its target cells.	The arrangement of the sugar hydrolases, sucrase-isomaltase, maltase, and lactase on the microvillus membrane of rat intestine was investigated by immunological technique.	In 2 groups of anaemic patients - 51 patients with iron deficiency anaemia and 45 patients with anaemia of chronic disorders - serum transferrin determination distinguishes the two groups of anaemic patients from normals somewhat better than TIBC determination.	The fasting S-insulin concentration was higher during glibenclamide therapy, while the increase in insulin concentration one hour postprandially was stronger during  glipizide therapy, supporting the concept that glibenclamide has a more prolonged and glipizide a more fast-acting effect on insulin secretion.	A low plasma zinc concentration was strongly associated with nutritional edema but not with the degree of edema or the plasma albumin concentration.	The nutritional status was evaluated by measuring changes in body weight, serum albumin levels and nitrogen balance.	When these solutions were the sole source of nutrients all patients were in negative nitrogen balance and had significant decreases in their serum albumin levels.	Infusion of exogenous prolactin (NIH-P-S11) at 1 mg/h for 10 h into ewes pretreated for 30 days with oestradiol benzoate and progesterone was unable to initiate milk secretion.	Increasing atherosclerosis correlated with decreasing ability to clear glucose in a tolerance test (P less than 0.01), decreasing insulin (P = 0.02), and increasing glucose (P less than 0.01) and triglycerides (P less than 0.01).	Evidence that stress hormones (glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol, and growth hormone) contribute to the metabolic decompensation of ketoacidosis includes: (1) in all cases of ketoacidosis, at least one stress hormone is always elevated; (2) pharmacologic blockade of each of the stress hormones reduces the rate and/or frequency of metabolic decompensation in diabetic man; (3) removal of the pituitary and/or the adrenal gland in diabetic animals completely prevents the development of ketoacidosis after insulin withdrawal; and (4) administration of each of the four stress hormones under appropriate conditions induces metabolic decompensation in diabetic man with "normal" circulating levels of plasma insulin concentration.	The data show that estradiol has a fairly rapid stimulatory effect on plasma levels of prolactin induced by two different secretagogues but the exact site and mechanism of action remain unresolved.	In experimental diabetes mellitus ocular vascular permeability was more closely correlated with insulin than blood glucose abnormalities.	Glucose oxidase, catalase, and bovine serum albumin were co-immobilized with glutaraldehyde around a platinum screen or around a single platinum-iridium wire.	They must undergo DNA synthesis and traverse the cell cycle in vitro before they are able to differentiate fully in response to insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin, and synthesize enzymatically active alpha-lactalbumin (measured as lactose synthetase activity).	Acute phase insulin release in response to iv glucose gradually increased throughout the study.	Reduction in tissue resistance to the action of insulin also appeared to be of major importance in the recovery of normal glucose tolerance in this subject.	To investigate the effect of orally administered testosterone undercanoate (TU) on circulating prolactin (PRL) and PRL response to TRH stimulation, 8 eugonadal male volunteers, aged 19--30, presenting with normal plasma levels of FSH, LH, testosterone (T), estradiol (E2) and PRL, were given 120 mg/day of TU for 6 days.	The effects of ouabain on renin secretion by rat renal cortical slices were studied.	It is proposed that, as a result of inhibition of Na, K-ATPase by ouabain, (a) intracellular Na increases in the renin-secreting juxtaglomerular cells, (b) intracellular Ca increases, via an Na-Ca exchange mechanism, and (c) that Ca accumulation, in some unknown manner, inhibits renin secretion.	No significant associations are seen when the MNSs, Kell, Lewis, Duffy, haptoglobin, red cell acid phosphatase, phosphoglucomutase, adenylate kinase, and adenosine deaminase distributions in these groups of subjects are compared.-	Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) balances, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose, plasma phosphate, immunoreactive insulin (IRI), and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) values were investigated.	Pimozide, dopamine receptor blocker, was effective in increase of serum prolactin in the stressed rats as well as in controls.	In pimozide pretreated rats, elevated serum prolactin levels decrease in 10 min by the immobilization and returned to the preimmobilization levels thereafter which were higher than those in stressed animals without pimozide treatment.	This study in normal male subjects further investigates the effects of dopaminergic-antidopaminergic interactions as manifested by the prolactin response to dopamine and neuroleptic drugs.	Incremental doses of dopamine hydrochloride (4 microgram/min, 15 microgram/min, 60 microgram/min, 300 microgram/min) were infused at a constant rate over 90-120 min after a fixed dose of a neuroleptic drug (sufficient for about half of the maximal prolactin response) had been given IV.	Parameters studied were temperature, presence of albumin or dithiothreitol, calcium concentration and anionic composition.	If longer storage periods are anticipated, inactivation is significantly retarded by addition of albumin or by decreasing the free calcium concentration of the storage salines.	One year after the operation the patient has normal blood glucose levels without exogenous insulin, despite treatment with prednisone.	The paper concerns the results of clinical trials of new specialized foods--protein, defatted and fat enpits as well as low lactose milk mixtures, which were used in dietotherapy of sick children with different disease entities (hypothrophy, bronchopulmonary abnormalities, emaciation pre- and postoperatively, mucoviscidosis, Laurence-Moon-Bardte-Biedle's syndrome, Marfan's syndrome, galactosemia, lactase deficiency).	The influence of oestrogen administered to the ovariectomized rat on the interaction between dopamine (DA) and thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) on the release of radioimmunoassayable (RIA) and [3H]leucine incorporated into prolactin ([3H]PRL) was examined in vitro.	The normal prolactin responses to stimulation (TRH metoclopramide) and suppression (L-dopa, bromocriptine) were also determined.	Ferritin has also been shown by electrophoretic and antigenic analysis to be present in protein fractions solubilized from isolated human syncytiotrophoblast microvillus plasma-membrane preparations, suggesting that ferritin may play an active role in the transfer of iron from maternal transferrin across the syncytiotrophoblast plasma membrane.	Marked activity is also seen in conscious Heidenhain-pouch dogs, against secretion stimulated by betazole and gastrin tetrapeptide.	The effects of single oral doses of 0.2 mg of lisuride hydrogen maleate, a semisynthetic ergot derivative, on serum levels of prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), cortisol and blood glucose were studied in six normal males.	A comparison was made between the growth hormone (GH) response to metoclopramide ('Maxolon'--Beecham Laboratories) and insulin induced hypoglycaemia in thirty-five short adolescent males.	Serum GH, after the administration of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) did not differ from values observed as spontaneous surges, in contrast to a consistent increase in thyrotropin and prolactin.	The main finding was that, in both age groups, CDC was significantly negatively correlated to the early phase of insulin response to an intravenous glucose load.	These data indicate that subjects with low insulin response to glucose have a higher capillary permeability than high responders, and that muscle capillary permeability increases with age.	Intracisternally administered neurotensin, which did not affect EMG activity by itself, antagonized the actions of MK-771 while somatostatin was inactive in this regard.	The tyrosinase activity in two sucrose gradient isolated melanosome fractions from a melanotic hamster melanoma was found to increase after alpha-chymotrypsin treatment.	Serum levels of prolactin, LH, FSH and testosterone were measured by radioimmunoassay.	Mean serum testosterone levels closely paralleled the annual pattern of prolactin.	Mean serum LH levels significantly decreased during the time when mean serum prolactin and testosterone levels were increasing and they increased again at the time of decreasing mean prolactin levels, i.e.	She was treated inhospital with vigorous fluid therapy and 5% dextrose in normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, glucose and insulin and showed improvement overnight.	However, after the VMNH injury glybenclamide caused a sharp insulin depletion in the islets, and a marked elevation of IRI and a decrease of sugar in the blood.	The effect of a sulfonylurea, glibenclamide, on the release of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin was studied in the isolated perfused rat pancreas.	At glucose concentrations of 1.1 mM or less, the drug stimulated somatostatin release, whereas glucagon release, after 2-3 min of increase, was markedly inhibited.	A moderate glucose load (6.7 mM) inhibited glibenclamide-induced release of somatostatin, whereas the two in combination exerted an additive action on insulin release.	We suggest a paracrine (local) interaction of somatostatin with the alpha and beta cells, which has an important role in the kinetics of insulin and glucagon release induced by sulfonylureas.	Transplantation resulted in a decrease in serum glucose, an increase in serum insulin, and a marked decrease in serum triacylglycerol, particularly in the sucrose-fed diabetic rats.	This notion is supported by the observation that cobalt ions, which block the calcium spike in these cells, completely abolished the stimulatory effect of TRH on the release of prolactin and growth hormone.	Data obtained in these experiments, together with data reported in the literature, suggest that the amplified prolactin response to TRH observed during cimetidine infusion, is likely to be connected with a blockade of H2-receptors rather than to unspecific actions of cimetidine.	Some of the functional implications of these vascular connexions are discussed, particularly the influence of the islet hormones insulin, glucagon and somatostatin upon the exocrine cells.	Cyclo-oxygenase derived products constituted the bulk of released label at short time intervals, but after ten minutes exposure to thrombin in the presence of albumin (0.5 mg/ml) and 3 mM calcium, radioactivity in the released products was equally distributed among cyclo-oxygenase derived products (TXB2 + PGD2 + HHT), HETE and free arachidonic acid.	The concentration of glucose and insulin in the plasma during total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was measured every 20 minutes during a 24-hour period in three subjects with granulomatous enterocolitis.	During a gravity drip, parallel variations in rate of flow and plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were seen, and both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred.	During a constant (pumped) infusion, plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were stable and normal.	The lysosomotropic agents, ammonium chloride and chloroquine, added to the culture medium of pseudopregnant Rabbit mammary gland, did not inhibit the initiation of casein synthesis by prolactin.	Converse-y, colchicine totally blocked the lactogenic action of prolactin without altering the down-regulation of the receptor.	MBHA did not appreciably impair the ability of TRH to stimulate TSH secretion or of perphenazine to stimulate prolactin secretion.	Bacillus cereus 569 is known to be resistant to lysis by lysozyme because of the presence of deacetylated glucosamine residues in its peptidoglycan, and cultures continued to grow even in the presence of lysozyme at 200 microgram ml-1.	Concentrations of plasma free fatty acids, immunoreactive insulin and glucagon, and of blood glucose, pyruvate, lactate and glycerol were indistinguishable on corresponding treatment days in the 2 groups but blood ketone bodies were lower in the 1.83 g/kg group.	Measurement of the effect of drugs on the in vivo rates of synthesis of rabbit liver organelle bound proteins were measured following individual treatments with the inducers phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene and PCB (a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls) and the inhibitors, cycloheximide, aflatoxin B1, chloramphenicol and actinomycin D. Following their isolation from a homogenate containing the combined livers of 14C-leucine injected experimental animals and 3H-leucine injected control animals, purified fractions of the following proteins were prepared: microsomal cytochrome b5, cytochrome P-450, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and proteolipids, outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase and proteolipids, inner mitochondrial membrane cytochrome c, NADH dehydrogenase and proteolipids, intermitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 and circulating serum albumin.	The rates of synthesis of cytochromes, reductases and of circulating serum albumin were inhibited following treatments with cycloheximide, aflatoxin B1 and actinomycin D. Actinomycin D appeared to inhibit the release of newly synthesized albumin into the bloodstream while chloramphenicol treatment appeared to inhibit the incorporation of cytochrome c into the mitochondria.	We have been successful in maintaining dissociated chick dorsal root ganglia neurons in a serum-free, defined medium composed of F12 synthetic medium and, substituting for serum, a combination of hormones (insulin, PTH, triiodothyronine, TRH, somatomedin, hydrocortisone, testosterone) and other factors (transferrin).	Despite apparently good health and normal plasma electrolytes, urea, and haematocrit, four of six jejunostomy patients were sodium-depleted with low plasma volume, low sodium excretion in the urine, and increased plasma renin activity and, in the three most severe cases, increased aldosterone.	L-Dopa, but not atropine pre-treatment, attenuated the prolactin (PRL) response to MET.	It is suggested that a higher gastric acid secretion is secondary to histamine production in gastric mucosa, induced by acetylcholine yields gastrin yields histidine decarboxylase mechanism.	Various parameters of three radial immunodiffusion systems, a kinetic nephelometer and two laser nephelometers were compared in a measurement of IgG and albumin in cerebrospinal fluid.	One to two weeks after the administration of betamethasone to the mother with threatened premature delivery, the intra-amniotic renin--angiotensin system was slightly suppressed.	Gliquidone treatment led to a decrease in plasma glucose, an increase in insulin and a diminution in glucagon concentration.	Fasting blood serum insulin, glucose and K+ ions concentrations were estimated in 50 children with protein calorie malnutrition.	Post-prandial glucose and insulin reponses did not significantly differ whether a high fat diet or a high carbohydrate diet was consumed.	In two groups of juvenile onset diabetics similar in age, weight, diet and daily insulin dosage (eight without C-peptide, group I; eight with C-peptide, group II) the serum levels of free and antibody bound insulin, C-peptide, glucose, lactate, alanine and FFA were determined over 24 h. In addition the affinity and binding capacity of the insulin antibodies were determined in vitro.	No correlation was found between free or bound insulin and glucose.	As a group, C-peptide secretors were better controlled than non-secretors with respect to mean blood glucose, M-value and the lability index and showed higher free insulin levels despite a similar daily insulin dosage.	However, four patients failed to show PRL elevation with insulin hypoglycemia and six were unresponsive to chlorpromazine.	In glands perfused at constant flow, parasympathetic stimulation led to a decrease in permeability-surface area for EDTA (-19.1 +/- 5.2%, mean +/- S.E., n = 5, P less than 0.05) cyanocobalamin (-12.3 +/- 6.0, n = 12, P less than 0.05), and insulin (-15.3 +/- 4.8, n = 11, P less than 0.02).	In perfused glands, ligation of the submandibular duct for 3--12 days reduced permeability-surface area (ml.min-1.g-1) for [51Cr]EDTA from 5.26 +/- 0.60 (mean +/- S.E., n = 9) to 4.20 +/- 0.12 (n = 4, P less than 0.30), [57Co]cyanocobalamin from 3.22 +/- 0.12 (n = 48) to 2.02 +/- 0.08 (n = 15, P less than 0.001) and [125I]insulin from 1.52 +/- 0.07 (n = 39) to 0.72 +/- 0.23 (n = 11, P less than 0.001).	Highly purified cytochrome P-450 from microsomes of the rabbit liver was immobilized on albumin modified Bio-gel P-300 using the glutaraldehyde method.	Propranolol (1.5 mg/kg) inhibited saralasin-induced renin release by 93% and enhanced the suppressant effect of indomethacin from 79% to 100%.	In these animals, indomethacin failed to alter basal SRA, but inhibited saralasin-induced renin release by 82%, urinary excretion of PGE2 by 79%, and arachidonate-induced hypotension by 81%.	These findings suggest 1) that saralasin-induced renin release is mediated by renal prostaglandins, and 2) an interrelationship exists between the receptor controlling AII-mediated inhibition of renin release, which is blocked by saralasin, and the juxtaglomerular beta-adrenergic receptor.	Repeatedly, raised insulin levels could be verified in response to high blood sugar loads.	Oral glucose load and arginine infusion resulted in a significantly enhanced insulin release.	Since albumin could not substitute for the amino acids in basal medium as a nitrogen source, it was concluded that the protein component in albumin was not utilized as a nutrient by the organisms.	An ether extract of fatty acid-free albumin supported a small but significant amount of growth.	It involves six consecutive steps: (1) extraction of the plasminogen activator from delipidated uterine tissue with 0.3 M potassium acetate buffer, pH 4.2; (2) ammonium sulphate precipitation; (3) zinc chelate-agarose chromatography; (4) n-butyl-agarose chromatography; (5) concanavalin A-agarose chromatography; and (6) gel filtration on Sephadex G-150.	Acid secretion stimulated by pentagastrin was not diminished after pre-treatment with compound 48/80 suggesting that gastrin releases non-mast cell histamine.	The lens, like the erythrocyte, is not dependent on insulin for glucose concentration in the extracellular milieu that would be elevated in the diabetic state.	Blood sugar, urea and electrolytes were estimated only at presentation and eight hours after commencing insulin therapy instead of the initial one to two hourly estimations usually advocated.	It is suggested that where facilities and staffing are inadequate, as in some developing countries, the first eight hours of treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis can be safely carried out using the frequent intramuscular low dose insulin regimen without much emphasis laid on monitoring the blood sugar, urea and electrolytes, provided there are no contraindicating cardio-pulmonary or renal diseases.	These observations lead us to postulate the lactase in the suckling rat might possess a translocating role for sugar, in addition to its hydrolytic function.	to define the insulin regiment that best controls their fasting and 2 hr postprandial blood glucose.	Each diabetic was allowed three days to stabilise on his usual insulin regimen and for the next three days blood glucose was estimated at the times indicated.	Then for the next three days the patient was given the other insulin regimen and then for the last three days and while still on this second regimen blood glucose was estimated at the time indicated.	The overall control of blood glucose before and two hrs meals was better with soluble insulin regiment than with the Lente insulin regimen.	FSH, prolactin, insulin and vitamins had no significant effect on hCG-stimulated testosterone levels.	Because the pancreas undergoes involutional changes during total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and because pancreatico-biliary secretions are trophic to the intestine, we studied jejunal and ileal structure and function and exocrine pancreatic function before and after 6 weeks of TPN in two groups of beagle dogs, one of which had TPN alone, the other having TPN plus daily stimulation of pancreatico-biliary secretions with intravenous infusions of cholecystokinin (CCK) and secretin.	The influence of this injection upon glucose metabolism, adipose cellularity, pancreatic morphology and immunoreactive insulin (IRI) release from isolated pancreatic islets was measured.	At this time, plasma glucose was still elevated in lean, but depressed in ob/ob mice and the insulin responsiveness in muscle and adipocytes was unchanged.	During a 72-hour fast, serum creatine phosphokinase rose more than 10 times, and myoglobin was detected in urine.	Ten animals then had successful pancreatic transplantation resulting in normal glucose and insulin levels within one to three weeks.	Islet transplantation in inbred diabetic rats effectively returns glucose and insulin levels to normal and results in rapid regression of the light microscopic and immunopathologic glomerular lesions.	The data presented in this paper show that when rabbit plasminogen is activated to plasmin by urokinase at least two peptide bonds are cleaved in the process.	This plasmin-altered plasminogen and the plasmin heavy chain derived from it by urokinase activation process NH2-terminal amino acid sequences which are identical with each other and with the plasminolytic product of the original plasmin heavy chain.	These studies support a mechanism of activation of plasminogen by urokinase which involves loss of a peptide located on the NH2 terminus of plasminogen.	Furthermore, these studies show that urokinase cannot remove this peptide from either the original rabbit plasminogen molecule or from the heavy chain of the initial plasmin formed.	Canine fibrinogen, subjected to proteolysis by urokinase-activated plasminogen for 24 h, contained degradation fragments D and E which were isolated by starch block electrophoresis and Sephadex G-200 gel-filtration.	The hyperglucagonemia that occurs in vivo in animals made diabetic with alloxan or streptozotocin is not suppressed by high glucose but is suppressed by exogenous insulin.	These observations together with other studies suggested that insulin-dependent glucose transport and metabolism by the alpha-cells serves as the primary mechanism controlling glucagon secretion.	The possible interactions between glucose, insulin, and a mixture of 20 amino acids at physiological proportions were examined in the isolated-perfusin diabetic rats.	10%) than the basal rates seen in controls; (b) the alpha-cells of alloxanized- and streptozotocin-treated rats responded with a biphasic glucagon release to stimulation by an amino acid mixture; (c) this alpha-cell response was reduced after both streptozotocin and alloxan; (d) glucose at 5 mM was a potent inhibitor of amino acid-induced glucagon secretion in both types of experimental diabetes; (e) in alloxan diabetes alpha-cell stimulation by amino acids can be curbed by exogenous insulin, whereas glucagon secretion by the perfused pancreas of streptoxotocin diabetic rats appeared to be resistant to insulin action.	The data indicate that the modulation of glucagon secretion by glucose in vitro is indipendent of insulin and that other unknown factors extrinsic to the pancreatic islets are responsible for the hyperglucagonemia observed in vivo.	Simultaneous administration of thrombin and epsilon-aminocaproic acid was associated with sustained high GFA and persistence of thrombi, presumably due to inhibition of the action of plasmin on fibrin, but it had no effect on tissue activators of plasminogen.	The present study investigated the possible influence of the following factors on the level of melanotropic activity in whole brain, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, midbrain, and brainstem of mouse and rat: age, sex, starvation; and of the following hormones or drugs administered by the intraperitoneal or intracerebral route: norepinephrine, dihydroxyphenylalanine, pargyline, 6-hydroxy-dopamine, alpha-methyltyrosine methyl ester, reserpine, acetylcholine, pilocarpine, atropine, serotonin, p-chlorophenylalanine, pentobarbital, pentylenetetrazol, insulin, melatonin, and cycloheximide.	However, insulin treatment prevented the development of impaired MNCV in a group of diabetic rats in which the tail vein plasma glucose concentration was never found to exceed 160 mg/dl during days 6 through 14, andin which the mean plus or minus SEM of the average plasma glucose concentration for each animal during the same period was 75 plus or minus 18 mg/dl.	The intravenous application of 60 mg streptozotocin/kg body weight to a Hanford miniature pig 8 days after a first dose of 30 mg/kg led to a diabetes with loss of insulin response to glucose, hyperglycaemia, glucosuria and a considerable increase of triglycerides and cholesterol.	As with glucose the insulin levels remained in the normal range, and the animals steadily gained weight.	These observations demonstrate that islet tissue implanted in the peritoneal cavities of diabetic rats receiving immunosuppressive chronic corticosteroid therapy can respond with a rapid and sufficient release of insulin to reverse diabetes as documented by normal glucose levels under stimulated and nonstimulated conditions.	The pretreated plasminogen was considered to be identical to the proteolytically degraded proenzyme with NH2-terminal lysine, valine or methionine, which is formed as an intermediate stage during activation of plasminogen.	Adenylate cyclase activity of plasma membranes from untreated animals is stimulated by parathyroid hormone and thyroxine; partial hepatectomy increased basal activity as well as the stimulation exerted by the aforementioned hormones, when glucagon and epinephrine sensitivity is essentially unaltered.	Purified streptokinase has in vitro a double biochemical activity on plasminogen.	The membrane fragments isolated after halothane release are in the form of biconcave ghosts, impermeable to macromolecules (lactoperoxidase) and small molecules (ATP).	Carbohydrate tolerance of these patients was previously examined, and 4 with normal glucose tolerance and normal insulin responses to arginine infusion had growth hormone levels significantly higher than controls at 30 min.	Glycogen content of the heart was not affected, but aortic elastin content was significantly reduced by silver and restored to normal by supplemental copper.	The effects of ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) lesions were studied in female rats made diabetic with streptozotocin that were given twice daily injections of protamine zinc insulin (0.75 mu/100g/day) and in non-diabetic animals of the same sex.	The infusion of insulin alone rapidly decreased blood glucose and ketone bodies, but caused an increase in blood lactate and pyruvate.	Dichloroacetate did not affect the response to insulin of blood glucose and ketone bodies, but abolished the increase of lactate and pyruvate seen after insulin infusion.	Neither insulin nor dichloroacetate stimulated glucose disappearance after functional hepatectomy, but both agents decreased the accumulation in blood of lactate, pyruvate and alanine.	It was concluded that: (a) dichloroacetate had qualitatively similar effects on glucose metabolism in severely ketotic rats to those observed in non-diabetic starved animals; (b) insulin and dichloroacetate both separately and together, decreased the net release of lactate, pyruvate and alanine from the extra-splachnic tissues, possibly through a similar mechanism; (c) insulin reversed the inhibition of 3-hydroxybutyrate uptake caused by dichloroacetate; (d) dichloroacetate inhibited ketone-body production in severe ketoacidosis.	Streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats regularly retained sodium (Na+), and tended to retain potassium (K+) as well, in response to insulin.	We assayed glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in ten patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors and the carcinoid syndrome ("active tumors") and in seven patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors without the carcinoid syndrome ("inactive tumors").	), suggesting that the decreased plasma insulin levels following intravenous glucose were due to impaired insulin secretion rather than accelerated insulin destruction.	The patients received cumulative doses of from 70 to 300 mg. of Strepto per kilogram body weight with no impairment in glucose tolerance or insulin secretion.	We conclude that there is high incidence of glucose intolerance (80%) and impaired insulin secretion in patients with the carcinoid syndrome and that serotonin plays a role in producing these alterations.	Under conditions where cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate formation was linear with respect to time and protein concentration, the enzyme was stimulated 3- to 6-fold by 10 mM NaF, 10- to 30-fold by 1 muM glucagon, 4- to 5-fold by 0.1 mM 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate, and in the presence of 3 muM GTP, 2-fold by 10 mug/ml of prostaglandin E1.	Various salts were found to stimulate basal activity slightly, but enhanced the response to NaF 3- to 4-fold, to glucagon 1.5- to 2-fold, to 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate 2- to 3-fold, and to prostaglandin E1 1.5-fold.	Livers from normal fetal animals were able to release glucose rapidly into the perfusate when they were exposed to glucagon, cyclic AMP, or an aglycemic perfusate, but they did not remove glucose rapidly from the perfusate, synthesize glycogen, or activate liver glycogen synthetase in response to hyperglycemia (Figs.	Insulin decreased glucose mobilization in response to aglycemia, but did not stimulate glucose uptake during hyperglycemia; insulin activated glycogen synthetase (Table 1; Figs.	The method has been used to investigate the mechanism of activation of human plasminogen by streptokinase.	A model consistent with the data is that streptokinase induces a conformational change in the plasminogen molecule, producing an active center which cleaves an internal peptide bond to produce plasmin.	The effect of a cadaver-derived vascular plasminogen activator (VA) on the degradation of fibrinogen, soluble fibrin monomer, and fibrin was studied and compared with the effect of equivalent fibrinolytic potencies of streptokinase (SK), urokinase (UK), and plasmin.	Both uricase and allantoicase are stable enzymes and do not undergo turnover; nor are they subject to feedback inhibition by ammonia.	By means of a novel technique for direct intravenous infusion of free fatty acids (FFA) into conscious dogs, it was found that the elevation of FFA levels in normal animals leads to a marked increase in insulin release and to a decrease in plasma glucose concentration.	Dogs with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were used for FFA infusion in order to test whether peripheral glucose utilisation would be suppressed by FFA in the absence of the usual insulin response.	This response to substrates, followed in sequential synthesis and enzymic sensitivity in the perfused liver of diabetic rats were reversed by pretreatment in vivo with glucose plus fructose, or insulin.	Glucose, fructose, insulin or cortisol added to e perfusion medium (in the absence of pretreatment in vivo) did not stimulate glycogen synthesis in diabetic rats.	In carps living since 4 months at 6, 20 or 30 degrees C, epinephrine or glucagon injections produce increase in plasma glucose but affect only slightly liver glycogen: lower is the temperature, slower and longer are the effect.	The effect of methysergide (MES, 2.5 mg/100 g body wt), a serotonin antagonist, on prolactin release has been studied in lactating and ovariectomized rats.	However, the ability of methysergide to release prolactin in rats with serotonin receptors presumably blocked, suggests that the serotonin receptor-blocking and the prolactin-releasing actions of MES are not related.	Liver was analyzed for protein and lipid; pancreas was weighed and analyzed for insulin; fat pads were weighed and discarded; and blood was analyzed for glucose and lipid.	The 13.5% BD diet increased the beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and cholesterol concentrations, decreased the glucose concentration in blood, and increased the insulin content of the pancreas.	Increased levels of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and lysozyme were demonstrable at 3 and 5 days, respectively, with urinary protein-supplemented cultures.	The rate of incorporation of [3H]deoxyuridine into DNA was strongly inhibited by 10(-5) M Methotrexate and 10(-6) M 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, however, the effect of urinary proteins on incorporation of [3H]uridine into RNA and lysozyme accumulation were not inhibited.	Both urine ammonia excretion and renal glutaminase activity increased at 120 and 600 days in response to metabolic acidosis.	Various drugs known to bind to serum albumin were examined to determine whether or not they influenced the level of free tryptophan in serum in vitro and in vivo.	Under physiological conditions, the effect of insulin on the liver metabolism plays the central role for the maintenance of blood sugar homeostasis.	This protein, which we have tentatively named phospholamban (lambda alpha mu beta alpha psi usilon epsilon omega = to receive) appears to particiapte in the regulation of calcium transport by the heart's SR and may play a role in the inotropic actions of drugs, such as epinephrine, which act upon the cyclic AMP-PK system.	The lectin effect is counteracted by insulin and L-epinephrine, and is completely abolished by the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol.	Despite the fact that 5-HT and insulin are stored together in the cytoplasmic granules of the B-cells, 5-HT was differentially depleted from this store by reserpine.	A marked disproportionality between 5-HT and insulin content was also induced by diazoxide.	Mucosal response of alkaline phosphatase, ATPase and disaccharidase (lactase, maltase and trehalase) activities to sex hormones were studied by comparing male and female rats and castrated males and by injecting testosterone into castrated males.	The finding that insulin does not stimulate the ATPase activity in conditions in which the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase component is maximally activated and especially the fact that ouabain can reproducibly inhibit insulin stimulation of the membrane-bound ATPase activity strongly suggest that interaction of insulin with its receptor upon the plasma membrane somehow stimulates the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase system (ouabain sensitive; ATP phosphohydrolase, EC (3.6.1.3).	The authors studied plasma renin activity (PRA), urinary epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine excretion and their mutual relationships in 54 healthy subjects under basal (recumbent) conditions and age-related orthostatic changes in these parameters.	The blood sugar curve rose relatively slowly after the injection after the injection and the maximum increase, which attained 360--400% of the resting value was usually recorded 20-30 min after glucagon administration.	An immunoassay for tyrosinase, using the modified bacteriophage technique, was developed: Tyrosinase of Neurospora was conjugated to bacteriophage T4 using glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent.	This process thus appears independent of growth hormone and insulin as well as testosterone and thyroid hormones.	It was found that a 30-minute incubation of fertilized loach eggs in the lactate or fumarate solutions decreases the glucokinase activity in the embryos of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 hours of their development, while the inhibitory effect of glucose on the enzyme activity is pronounced only after 18 and 24 hours of the development.	Without epinephrine, no hypoglycemia developed in pertussis-sensitized rats despite the higher blood level of insulin.	A 24 hours fast decreases by 50% the first and second phases of insulin response to glucose by the isolated and perfused rat pancreas, while the response to tolbutamide remains unchanged.	Intra peritoneal administration of low doses of glucose (0.3 g), four times during fasting restored the insulin response.	The islets responded to glucose stimulation in vivo with insulin secretion similar to that of control rats, while only a very slight elevation of the low basis levels in streptozotocin-treated rats was observed.	The study was performed on 60 Wistar white rats sacrificed 24 hours and 7 days after administration of glycoprotein 8 (extracted from Jensen rat tumors), glycoprotein 5 (from normal rat blood), bovine albumin, tuberculin (PPD), and a complex of strychnine, picrotoxin and TPP administered alone or together with the above-mentioned antigens.	During exercise the rise of plasma glycerol was higher in diabetic than in control animals, but changes in circulating free fatty acids, acetone bodies, insulin, corticosterone, lactate, and acid-base equilibrium were similar in the two groups.	The metabolism of both testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone by 10 adenocarcinomas induced and grown in the presence of high prolactin (plasma prolactin greater than 220 ng/ml) was compared with the metabolism of 10 adenocarcinomas induced and grown in the presence of normal levels (plasma prolactin less than 60 ng/ml).	The tumors associated with high prolactin significantly metabolized more testosterone to both 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone and 5alpha-androstanediol.	The isografts normalized not only plasma glucose and insulin levels but also the elevated plasma immunoreactive glucagon level.	The in vitro basal insulin secretion and prompt sensitivity to glucose were shown directly by perfusing isolated livers containing transplanted islets.	Histochemical staining techniques applied to the immune precipitates formed with human antibodies indicated that none of the antigens detected in crude group C and group A streptococcal concentrates possessed catalase, glucuronidase, glucosaminidase, acid or alkaline phosphatase, arylsulfatase, leucineaminopeptidase, or chymotrypsin enzymatic activities.	The factor was induced in fasted animals specifically by glucose, of the nutrients tested, and in diabetic animals by insulin.	Induction by both glucose and insulin was blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin.	Increased levels of the factor preceded the increased levels of PFK-L2 brought about by glucose or insulin administration.	To study the possible implication of endogenous serotonin in the control of glucagon secretion in man, normal volunteers were subjected to alpha-cell stimulation before and after oral treatment with serotonin antagonists (cyproheptadine and methysergide) and with an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis (para-chlorophenylalanine, PCPA).	After administration of cyproheptadine (16 mg daily, for two days) the glucagon responses to arginine (N=12) and to insulin-induced hypoglycemia (N=9) were more marked than in the control experiments (differences between maximal elevations: +165 pg/ml, P less than 0.0001, and +197 pg/ml, P less than 0.02, respectively).	After methysergide treatment (9 mg daily, for two days), a potentiation of arginine-provoked glucagon secretion was also observed (+260 pg/ml, P less than 0.002; N=7).	Serum prolactin levels are significantly greater among hypertensive patients receiving reserpine as compared to levels six weeks after discontinuing the treatment (P less than .005).	This association between regular, long-term reserpine use and greater prolactin levels may be clinically significant, since an increased incidence of breast cancer has been reported among hypertensive patients receiving reserpine.	injection of glucose to produce hyperglycaemia in normal rabbits, nor after parenteral or topical administration of insulin.	Use of a removable skull capsule allowed serial observations on individual animals and these, together with observations on rabbits injected first with alloxan and later with daily insulin, showed reversibility of the increased ADP sensitivity by regular insulin injection for at least 5 days; this effect did not depend upon return of blood glucose levels to normal.	We obtained the 3 following results : the urine remained isotonic to the plasma during the 6 hours following the furosemide injection ; the urinary output of sodium and water, measured during 6 hours after furosemide injection, was increased ; the renin hypersecretion was inhibited.	Glycolysis was stimulated by increased work in heart perfused with glucose alone or with glucose, high levels of insulin, and low levels of palmitate.	With glucose, insulin, and palmitate present, stimulation of glucose utilization was rapid and correlated with activation of phosphofructokinase.	The utilization of the glucose taken up by the muscle cells for synthesis of glycogen is unchanged in the diabetic animals and can be stimulated by insulin correspondingly as in normal rats.	In these streptozotocin-treated animals, baseline glucagon secretion was enhanced when the perfusate glucose concentration was either 80 mg./100 ml.	Baseline and arginine-stimulated glucagon secretion of the streptozotocin treated animals was not suppressed by large amounts of glucose and insulin to the degree seen in control animals.	The glucagon rise in response to an abrupt fall of glucose from 80 mg./100 ml.	The present results are compatible with the hypothesis that local insulin secretion can exert a significant suppressive effect upon the alpha cell and that the inhibition of glucagon secretion by glucose is partially mediated by this mechanism.	The basal rate of glucose incorporation into the lipids was enhanced in the explants cultured with insulin.	Thus, it seems that prolonged exposure to insulin leads to a diminished acute effect of the hormone on glucose metabolism.	Most probably, then, this stimulating effect of insulin is exerted on the membrane and the rate of glucose transport.	Obese-SZO mice maintained insulin levels and body weights similar to lean controls, though they were shorter and fatter, while food intake and blood sugar levels exceeded lean values.	Obese-SZO-Ins mice with reduced islet hyperplasia, but great insulin resistance, gained more weight than obese-SZO mice; had high serum insulin and controlled blood glucose; and exhibited hyperphagia.	Additional treatment with immunostimulating (BCG, albumin, vitamin A-acid) or immunodepressive agents (hydrocortisone, cyclophosphamide, methotrexat) which was started 6 days after birth and maintained throughout life, did not influence carcinogenesis with respect to tumor incidences and induction periods of tumors.	Additional treatment with immunodepressive (cyclophosphamide, methotrexat, hydrocortisone) and immunostimulating substances (BCG, albumin, vitamin A-acid) as well as an enzyme-stimulating agent (Luminal) did not alter incidences and induction periods of tumors.	After lysis of Pseydomonas testosteroni with lysozyme and non-ionic detergents different DNA-protein complexes can be separated in 5-25% (w/v) neutral sucrose gradient.	Glibenclamide stimulates the insulin secretion by the isolated and perfused rat pancreas, but does not inhibit glucagon secretion when the perfusion liquid contains 1.5 g/I glucose.	In the absence of glucose in the perfusion medium, glibenclamide stimulates both insulin and glucagon secretions.	Electrical stimulation of the HPC, 1-AMYG or CG under light ether anesthesia just before the critical period prevented a rise in serum LH, FSH and prolactin levels at 18:00.	In regard to the prolactin release, it was inhibited by the stimulation of the HPC, 1-AMYG or CG in both the non-treated rat and in the atropine or PCPA-treated one, while in the reserpine-treated rat it was not inhibited but rather was facilitated by these stimulations.	With this dose, plasma glucose reached a maximum of over 600 mg/100 ml., and plasma insulin was reduced by 60 per cent.	When human plasminogen (Glu-Pga) is activated by urokinase in the presence of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, the plasmin produced (Glu-Pma) exclusively contains a heavy chain (Glu-Ha) derived intact from the original NH2 terminus of Glu-Pga.	Blood samples were taken at regular intervals for 75 minutes and analysed for blood glucose, insulin, and growth hormone (HGH).	The effect of orally administered ipratropiumbromide and propanthelinbromide on the basic gastric secretion as well as on the gastric secretion stimulated by pentagastrin or hypoglycemia due to application of insulin was tested intraindividually in a double blind comparative study.	Prekallikrein, plasminogen and prothrombin of human blood plasma have been separately activated by caolin streptokinase and thromboplastin.	By addition of pilocarpine, cobalt chloride, and aprotinin to the culture medium, pancreatic tissue insulin levels stabilized.	These drugs, however, induced no change in the ANS-fluorescence associated by serum albumin or lecithin.	In the streptozotocin-diabetic heart insulin strongly increased the specific radioactivities of the direct glycogen precursors glucose 1-phosphate and UDP-glucose; the effect of insulin on glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate was less marked.	The effects of insulin in vitro on carrier-mediated glucose transport were investigated in tumor cells from diabetic rats.	This unusual response in v to insulin was observed when glucose was present in the medium at 2 mM and 5 mM, but not at 20 mM glucose.	The apparent decrease in glucose entry in vitro may in part explain the ability of insulin to inhibit growth of this tumor in vivo.	Both drugs depressed the insulin response at one and two hours incubation but higher molar concentrations of the nitrosourea were required to produce the same level of inhibition as streptozotocin, a difference perhaps related to the latter's glucose moiety.	Hereditary polymorphism of transferrin is studied by means of starch gel electrophoresis in a group of healthy inhabitants of Minsk (250 persons) and in a group of schizophrenic patients (128 persons).	The differential diagnosis of stenosing processes and additional information concerning space-occupying lesions was furthered by small bowel hypotonia induced by the intravenous injection of 15 to 45 mg. propantheline bromide (Probanthine) or 1 to 2 mg. glucagon.	Inhibitor I with a molecular weight of about 8700 (estimated by gel filtration) is a very strong inhibitor of bull sperm acrosin but also inhibits bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin and porcine plasmin; inhibition of porcine pancreatic and urinary kallikrein was not observed.	Inhibitor II with a molecular weight near 6800 (estimated by gel filtration) inhibits bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin, porcine plasmin and pancreatic and urinary kallikrein as well as bull acrosin.	The IRI content in the transplant added to that in the host pancreas totaled 13% of the IRI found in the normal mouse pancreas, which sufficed for over-all recovery from diabetes but was insufficient to provide normal glucose tolerance and  insulin response to a major glucose challenge.	The abnormally high content of glucagon noted in the pancreas of hyperglycemic, sham transplanted mice was reduced by one-half in the pancreas of those transplanted mice returning to normal plasma glucose and insulin.	In the isolated perfused rat pancreas various sulfonylurea drugs were tested with a basal glucose level of 1 mg/ml in the perfusion buffer and were found to cause a biphasic insulin response.	NOVOCS 476, a new and potent sulfonylurea, and glibenclamide qualitatively differed from tolbutamide, glibornuride, glipizide, and glisoxepide, which were all alike in terms of the relationship between first and second phases of insulin release.	When this isolated light (B) chain derivative was mixed in equal molar amounts with streptokinase, the mixture developed both human and bovine plasminogen activator activities; the bovine activator activity was approximately 66% of the bovine activator activity of the equimolar human plasmin-streptokinase complex.	Inhibition of plasmin by the inhibitor is almost instantaneous even at 0 degrees, in contrast to the slow inhibition of urokinase (plasminogen activator in urine).	The assayable activity of fructose diphosphatase was not increased by glucagon, monobutyryl cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (mb-cAMP), or epinephrine, nor was it inhibited by insulin.	The results reported here demonstrate (1) a behavior of phosphofructokinase which is not predictable on the basis of its known solubility properties, and (2) differential effects of glucagon and epinephrine on the activity of phosphofructokinase which suggest that separate mechanisms are operative in stimulation of glucoeogenesis by glucagon and epinephrine.	Fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum immunoreactive insulin (IRI), plasma immunoreactive glucagon (IRG), body weight, and caloric intake were measured in long-term islet-isografted rats eight to 10 months following intraperitoneal islet transplantation in in age-matched, sham-operated, concurrently followed normal and diabetic controls.	When human plasminogen and the bacterial protein streptokinase are mixed, a tight equimolar complex is formed in which an active center of well defined hydrolytic activity developes; this event precedes the cleavage of the plasminogen chain, i.e.	Immediately after the formation of the complex, a series of proteolytic transformations occurs which, within a few minutes, results in at least two cleavages in the plasminogen, and at least five cleavages in the streptokinase peptide chains.	gastrin, secretin, enterogastrone).	Local X-ray irradiation of a transplantable rat tumour in a single dose of 3000 R increased significantly the extracellular space of this tumor as estimated by the plasma-tissue equilibration of 51Cr-EDTA, while the plasma and red blood cell volume as estimated with 125I-labeled albumin and 59Fe-labelled erythrocytes after sacrifice by bleeding under ether anaesthesia were unchanged.	In the yeasts C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. stellatoidea but not in C. krusei, R.rubra, and S. cerevisiae enzyme activity was found by which--as by the catechol-O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.6) found in the liver--the O-methylation of epinephrine to metanephrine and paranephrine, of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid to 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoic acid and 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid, and of 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin to 7-hydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin and 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin is catalysed.	No correlation exists between the serum protein binding of phenylbutazone and the concentration of serum albumin, urea and creatinine.	Fresh plasma was seeded with trace amounts of highly purified biologically intact iodine-labelled plasminogen and the plasmin-inhibitor complexes formed after activation with streptokinase or urokinase separated by gel filtration.	Administration of reserpine for a few days, did not modify either insulin response or blood glucose fall in thyrotoxic patients.	The intraportal injection of 350 to 1,000 isolated islets into streptozotocin-diabetic rats immediately normalized (approximately 24 hours) fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels.	Arginine infusion resulted in normal glucose and insulin rise in the nondiabetic patients with Huntington's disease.	To test this hypothesis glucose, ATP, glucagon, and insulin were measured in pancreatic islets of normal and alloxan or streptozotocin diabetic rats.	In the first, the pancreas was perfused in vitro for assessing insulin and glucagon release due to 10 mM amino acids with and without 5 mM glucose.	After perfusion, the pancreas was frozen and processed for analysis of islet glucose, ATP, insulin, and glucagon content.	The second approach was to investigate the islet sucrose, urea, and glucose spaces together with ATP, insulin, and glucagon content in vivo in normal and in insulin-treated and untreated streptozotocin diabetic rats.	Finally, insulin infused in high concentrations or administered to the diabetic animal had no effect on the glucose spaces or the ATP contents of normal or alpha-cell islets.	Since in normals an extracellular glucose concentration of this magnitude inhibits stimulated glucagon release completely, it would seem unlikely that a lack of intracellular glucose is the cause of the apparent glucose "blindness" of the alpha-cells in diabetes.	In fact, in perfusion studies as little as 2.5 mM free intracellular glucose was sufficient to suppress glucagon secretion from diabetic alpha-cells.	The oxygen carrying function of FC-80 was evaluated from measurements of serum albumin synthesis and incorporation of 14C-lysine into the proteins in the medium.	The materials secreted by phagocytes can be grouped into three categories: a) enzymes affecting extracellular proteins (collagenase, elastase, lysosomal proteases, plasminogen activators), b) materials involved in defense processes (complement proteins, interferons, lysozyme), and c) factors regulating activities of surrounding cells.	8 The changes in brain tryptophan upon aminophylline injection may be explained by (a) increased availability of plasma tryptophan to the brain due to increased lipolysis and (b) increased effectiveness of uptake of tryptophan by the brain due to increased insulin secretion.	On the isolated perfused rat pancreas phenformin at high concentrations (10 mg/1, 50 mg/1 and 100 mg/1) provokes an increase of the insulin and lactate output in the effluent liquid.	There exists a statistically significant correlations between the increase in insulin output and the increase in lactate output induced by phenformin.	As to insulin secretion, it is strongly stimulated only in the presence of a glucose concentration of 1.5 g/1.	We treated streptozotocin diabetic rats with insulin and compared their duodenal calcium transport response with that of untreated diabetics and matched controls.	Since insulin treatment restores duodenal calcium transport, the renal defects is unlikely to be caused by streptozotocin nephrotoxicity.	Withdrawal of insulin from insulin-treated streptozotocin-diabetic rats resulted in a decrease in hepatic triglyceride lipase activity.	It is concluded that hepatic triglyceride lipase, like adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase, is under hormonal regulation by insulin.	Those tumors showing the lowest conversion of testosterone to estradiol-17beta possessed the highest levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase which lends support to data implicating sulfurylation in the regulation of steroid metabolism in human tumors.	A series of coagulation experiments were conducted by determining the sedimentation rate of calcium carbonate suspension with respect to the following substances: sodium alginate, stone matrix substance, bovine albumin and chondroitin sulfate C, these were each added to a separate fine particle suspension of calcium carbonate.	A method for determining initial velocities of the urokinase (EC 3.4.99.26) catalysed converstion of NH2-terminal lysine plasminogen to plasmin (EC 3.4.21.7) is presented.	Hereditary polymorphism of haptoglobin is studied by means of starch gel electrophoresis in schizophrenic patients (200 persons) and in healthy people (154 persons), in habitants of Minsk.	Native Glu-human plasminogen (Mr approximately 92,000 with NH2-terminal glutamic acid) is able to combine directly with streptokinase in an equivalent molar ratio, to yield a stoichiometric complex.	From these studies we conclude (a) in the streptokinase-plasminogen complex, the NH2-terminal peptide need not be released prior to the cleavage of the essential Arg-Val peptide bond which leads to the formation of a two chain plasmin molecule and (b) that this peptide is cleaved from the native plasminogen or from the heavy chain of the initially formed plasmin in the streptokinase complex by free plasmin and not by the plasmin associated with streptokinase.	After activation of plasminogen by streptokinase, plasmin is determined using its amidasic action on a tripeptidic substrate bound with paranitroanlin.	The photodynamic deactivation of lysozyme in presence of acridine orange is caused by a reaction between singlet oxygen formed via the dye triplet state and the protein.	It is based upon the conversion of plasminogen into activator by large and constant amounts of streptokinase.	The activator contained in a standard coagulum consisting of bovine fibrin, streptokinase, and a 1:40 dilution of human plasma converts the plasminogen adsorbed on bovine fibrin into plasmin.	5,000 u streptokinase per hour, as well as 270,000 CTA-u urokinase per hour, infused over a period of 2 days produced a fall in plasminogen down to 30-60% of normal.	In contrast, 100,000 u streptokinase per hour lowered the plasminogen concentration down to values of below 1%.	The foregoing data indicate that plasminogen measurement, according to the principles outlined here (activator assay), may be regarded as a valuable and reliable method for the routine control of streptokinase and urokinase therapy.	The test clot constituents were bovine fibrinogen, bovine plasminogen, EDTA, human plasma (with unknown activator concentrations), and thrombin.	This result is in agreement with earlier findings where the activator complex was demonstrated to be a widely dissociated complex in highly diluted plasma of patients, thus displaying an ample proportion of free streptokinase and plasminogen and molecules.	Streptokinase treatment using dosage schemes of 100,000 u SK/h, and 200,000 u/h were monitored by quantitative activator, streptokinase, and plasminogen measurements.	The fibrinolytic response of 12 patients receiving single daily infusions of 600,000 units of streptokinase (SK) and 90 mg of plasminogen for the treatment of DVT has been studied.	The pathogenesis of this disorder based on the formation of an autoantibody with specificity for transferrin thus producing a circulating immune complex which bound the majority of serum iron.	Immunosuppression achieved a partial remission including a recovery of the patient's general state, a rise in free transferrin, a decrease in serum iron, disappearance of hemosiderin in the liver, and a rise in erythrocyte production.	Fenfluramine stimulates the glucose uptake of the isolated hemidiaphragm from normal and streptozotocin diabetic rats in the presence of insulin.	A single dose of fenfluramine significantly lowered the blood glucose levels in streptozotocin diabetic rats and in diabetic dogs treated with insulin.	Additional treatment for one week of insulin dependent diabetic dogs with small non-anorexic doses of fenfluramine resulted in slightly decreased blood glucose levels.	The dogs could not be maintained on fenfluramine alone (without insulin).	Absence of divalent cations, addition of external ATP and of insulin enhance the ouabain inhibition of recovery.	The absence of divalent cations, addition of external ATP and of insulin significantly enhanced the amount of ouabain bound.	In subjects affected by amenorrhoea with hyperprolactinaemia treated with bromocriptine a clear decrease of DHAS correlating with a decrease of plasma prolactin was observed.	The metabolic responses to an oral glucose tolerance test (100 g) and an intravenous insulin provocation test (0-1 i.u./kg) were studied in nine control subjects and nine patients with Huntington's chorea.	Hypoglycaemia produced by levodopa did not appear to involve stimulation of insulin secretion since plasma IRI levels were not increased by levodopa and the hypoglycaemia was accompanied by a elevation of plasma FFA and no significant change in the liver glycogen content.	Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHAS), androstenedione (A), testosterone (T), estrone (E1), estradiol (E2) and gonadotropins were measured in 3 normal adult men before and after administration of 50 mg ovine prolactin for 5 days.	In the presence of insulin, the uptake of glucose and 3-O-methyl glucose, a non-metabolizable sugar, by fat pads from deficient rats was greater than uptake by fat pads from control rats.	Luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and prolactin levels were normal, and testosterone reduced.	The time course of the decrease in the rat serum ceruloplasmin concentration after the same dose of colchicine was then studied.	Eight hours after the administration of colchicine, the serum ceruloplasmin level began to rise again in female rats, but not in male rats.	Initial velocities for the urokinase (EC 3.4.99.26)-catalysed conversion of glutamic acid plasminogen to plasmin (EC 3.4.21.7) have been determined at various urokinase and glutamic acid plasminogen concentrations.	When nurses were transferred from the Western to a vegetarian diet, the menstrual cycle was shortened, while their prolactin and testosterone decreased.	In these rats, serum insulin fell to minimal levels during the 48 h following drug treatment, and this was roughly paralleled by a progressive decrease in the ability of the lung to oxidize glucose.	The addition of insulin to diabetic rat lung slices in vitro had no restorative effect on the depressed glucose oxidative rate during a 2 h incubation period; however, two daily treatments of the rats with 1 unit of protamine, zinc insulin completely restored lung glucose oxidation rate to normal, without significantly reducing the hyperglycemic state of the rats.	An examination of the temporal changes in glucose utilization by the rat lung after acute insulin treatment revealed that the diabetic lung responded directly to serum levels of insulin, whereas the normal lung appeared to be unaffected by serum insulin levels as hihg as 87 ng/ml.	These observations suggest that insulin regulates the transport and utilization of glucose in the rat lung, and that this tissue contains specific receptors for insulin.	Seven laboratories collaborating in a study of two intermediate purity plasminogen preparations (64/23, 63/6) observed that the amount of activator (urokinase or streptokinase) and the time of activation of plasminogen influenced the amount of plasmin generated.	Oestradiol raised adenohypophyseal weight, the binding capacity of the adenohypophyseal proteins for thyroxine and the serum ceruloplasmin level.	The blood glucose level and food consumption were determined 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after injecting the insulin.	On using albumins of different origin (human, bovine), the pD2 values for catecholamines differed by more than one order, in correlation to the type of albumin used.	It was concluded in the discussion that catecholamines are oxidized at different rates in different albumin media and that this oxidation can be inhibited by adding ascorbic acid.	Immobilized trypsin, plasmin, papain, chymotrypsin and urokinase exhibited the fibrinolytic effect due to convertion of plasminogen into plasmin.	It may be inferred that improvement of nitrogen retention in meal fed rats is not related to an increase in insulin secretion.	In muscle, insulin binding and insulin effect on glucose uptake and metabolism changed in parallel--i.e., when binding increased, tissue sensitivity to the hormone increased.	The persistance of steroid sex hormones and the rise of plasma prolactin might explain the poor response to dexamethasone treatment in mammary carcinoma.	Protein and lipid levels were determined in liver; insulin in pancreas; and glucose, insulin, and lipid in blood.	DPTH produced a significant elevation of blood glucose concentration of the diabetic rats that was not, however, correlated with altered pancreatic insulin concentration.	The reactivity of spleen lymphocytes in a mixed lymphocyte culture and the in vivo PFC response to sheep erythrocytes have been evaluated in pregnant female mice and data compared with those observed in virgin sexually mature female mice daily treated either with progesterone or human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) or human prolactin.	Comparable immunological modifications have been found in mice treated with HCG, but not in animals treated with progesterone or prolactin.	Glucagon caused a rise in glucose 3 hours after a meal with a fall in lactate and alanine; no effect of glucagon was seen after a 12-hour fast.	Acini isolated from the glands of starved, insulin or prolactin-deficient rats had a higher production of lactate and pyruvate from glucose than did glands from normal rats; this is in agreement with the reported decrease in the proportion of active pyruvate dehydrogenase in these situations [Field & Coore (1976) Biochem.	Addition of insulin did not increase the uptake of glucose by acini from normal glands, but it caused a significant increase in the utilization of glucose by acini from glands of starved rats.	Animals transplanted in this way, however, fail to exhibit a normal biphasic insulin response during an intravenous glucose tolerance test.	2 Tolbutamide and phentolamine increased the plasma insulin concentrations by 100% and 300% respectively but with little effect on the brain/plasma ratios for the aromatic amino acids.	Previously propranolol was found to decrease plasma insulin by 50% without altering the above ratios.	The presence of potassium ions (60-100 mM), bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) or protein from cell-free Escherichia coli extract (10 microgram/ml) prevents the cessation of the activity.	Once the cessation has occurred, the activity of the enzyme can be completely restored by the addition of potassium ions, but not by bovine serum albumin.	On the basis of these results and other observations it is hypothesized that during the degradation of DNA in the absence of potassium ions or bovine serum albumin the recBC enzyme is subject to an alteration of its molecular conformation which results in an inactive form.	In 69 male acne patients, 15--24 years old and 17 young men of the same age plasma FSH, prolactin, testosterone and estradiol are determined.	Both substances provoke a decrease in insulin secretion produced by phenformin.	In the presence of a glucose concentration of 1.5 g/1 the secretion of insulin from the isolated perfused rat pancreas is clearly weaker at 28 degrees C than at 37.5 degrees C. In response to cholinergic stimulation, the absolute increase of insulin secretion rate is less at 28 degrees C than at 37.5 degrees C. However, when evaluated in percentage in relation to the baseline value, this increase is more important at the lower temperature.	As to glucagon secretion, lowering of the temperature from 37.5 degrees C to 28 degrees C modifies neither this secretion in the presence of glucose alone, nor the increased secretion provoked by the cholinergic stimulation.	In all animals, muscle lipoprotein lipase activities were not correlated to plasma glucagon levels.	All plasminogen present in synovial fluid could be activated to plasmin upon addition of urokinase (24 nM/1).	The perfusion is made of defibrinated blood to which is added a compounding of mineral salts, albumin and glucose in adequate proportions.	Washing with label-free Ringer's solution for 90 min extracted only 10% of the inhibitor, an amount which corresponded to ouabain present in the tissue spaces labeled by [(14)C]insulin.	A low concentration of plasminogen activator, immunologically identical with urokinase, and its accumulation in culture supernate were found with RT 4 after 12 h and 24 h cultivations, whereas no plasminogen activator was detected in all other cell lines for periods up to 36 h. No plasmin, non-specific protease or plasmin inhibitory activities were detected in any of the supernates from the cell lines.	Plasma membranes were isolated from rat livers at various times after partial hepatectomy, and the specific activities of alkaline phosphatase, (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, leucine aminopeptidase, 5'-nucleotidase, and adenylate cyclase (basal and with glucagon or epinephrine) were measured.	The response of adenylate cyclase to epinephrine showed a transitory increase between 36 and 108 h after surgery, while the response to glucagon was decreased by approximately 50% at all time points through 324 h after surgery.	In the presence of a glucose concentration of 1.5 g/1, ATP provokes a biphasic stimulation of insulin secretion from the isolated and perfused rat pancreas.	Lowering the temperature from 37.5 degrees C to 28 degrees C provokes a decrease in insulin secretion induced by glucose (1.5 g/1).	On the other hand, epididymal fat pads of rats pretreated with phenformin display a lower response to insulin than that of non treated rats.	The hypoglycemic effect of the same dose of insulin is less important in the normal dog after chronic pretreatment with phenformin.	Biochemical (myocardial DNA, RNA, and hydroxyproline) and humoral (plasma [PRA] and kidney [KRA] renin activity) factors were determined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar controls (NR) before and following treatment with minoxidil or propranolol.	Nine samples of human ceruloplasmin [iron(II):oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1.16.3.1] prepared by different procedures have been examined for heterogeneity; gel electrophoresis showed that seven contained a number of components with molecular weights ranging from 20,000 to 130,000, and two contained largely a single component of molecular weight 130,000.	Assays for antithrombin III and heparin using S-2222 as the substrate and factor Xa as the enzyme, plasma plasminogen and plasmin inhibitors using S-2251 as the substrate, and plasma prekallikrein and kallikrein inhibitors using Chromozym PK as the substrate have been developed.	of insulin in the ovulary fluid of 14th day rabbit embryo, produces less anomalies than the injection of the same concentration of glucose alone.	Immunocytochemical quantitation of the distribution of insulin (B), glucagon (A), somatostatin (D) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) producing cells revealed a significant relative increase in the number of A cells and a decrease in the number of B cells of the sclerosis islets in primary chronic pancreatitis ((B-44.1+/-9.3%:A-38.3+/-2.4%:D-8.6+/-5.1%:PP-4.6+/-4.1%) as well as in secondary chronic pancreatitis B-38.0+/-14.3%:A-38.4+/-19.0%:D-9.1+/-5.8%:PP-14.5+/-23.4%) compared with controls (B-71.1+/-8.1%:A-24.3+/-5.5%:D-8.0+/-2.8%:PP-0.5+/-0.4%).	Serum concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone, DHA sulfate, estradiol, and prolactin in 20 girls with precocious adrenarche were compared with those of healthy girls of varying age and degrees of breast and sex hair development.	The adverse effect of serotoninergic activation on glucose tolerance is not sufficiently explained by the observed changes in insulin and glucagon secretion during the fasting state and after intravenous glucose and arginine infusions.	Each dose of streptokinase produced an immediate fall in plasminogen to 17% (SEM 5.1) of the initial value, the level then rose to 50% (SEM 5.4) within 24 hr.	High concentrations of chondroitin sulphate A, B and C and heparitin sulphate partly or completely inhibited the response of CFU-E to erythropoietin stimulation whereas addition of heparin, hyalyronic acid and keratan sulphate II in concentrations up to 100 microgram/ml did not elicit an inhibition of erythrocytic colony formation.	These results indicate that, in spite of having an increased glycolytic metabolism, spermatozoa from oligospermic men are are able to show additional glucose utilization in the presence of prolactin.	The ability of insulin to inhibit efflux of potassium (K) and amino acid nitrogen (AAN) from perfused livers of normal and insulin deficient rats was studied.	This interpretation was confirmed by the observation that urokinase, a plasminogen activator, in the presence of plasminogen brought about marked degradation of basic protein in myelin.	In all these groups of patients, known to have significantly lowered plasma iron levels, the transferrin levels were found to be decreased with respect to the control group.	Clinically useful assays for antithrombin III and heparin using S-2222 as the substrate and factor Xa as the enzyme, plasma plasminogen and plasmin inhibitors using S-2251 as the substrate, and plasma prekallikrein and kallikrein inhibitors using Chromozym PK as the substrate have been developed.	An inhibitor of adrenal steroid biosynthesis, aminoglutethimide, was administered to seven patients with low renin essential hypertension, and the antihypertensive action of the drug was compared with its effects on adrenal steroid production.	Plasma renin activity was not significantly increased after 4 days of treatment but had risen to the normal range by the termination of aminoglutethimide therapy.	The observation that chronic administration of aminoglutethimide lowered blood pressure in these patients and elevated their plasma renin activity to the normal range without decreasing production of the adrenal steroids, deoxycorticosterone, 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone, and 16beta-hydroxydehydroepiandrosterone, makes it unlikely that these steroids are responsible either for the decreased renin or the elevated blood pressure in patients with low renin essential hypertension.	Clearance studies were performed immediately afterward, and plasma and urine were analyzed for inulin, pH, sodium, glucose, and lysozyme.	The initial blood sugar level (before administering insulin) was not in any way correlated to insulin tolerance determined at various intervals during fasting.	A seven-fold administration to adrenalectomized animals of nicotinic acid, thiamine or a simple injection of nicotinamide normalize the transketolase activity through raising the TDP level.	The isopycnic equilibrium of [131J]albumin digesting particles from mouse liver homogenates occurs, in a sucrose gradient, at a density 1.25, and it does not change with time after albumin injection (5 to 300 minutes).	By the enzyme-labeled antibody method, cells containing somatostatin (SRIF) as well as insulin or glucagon were identified in pancreatic islets of the rat.	Experiments with adrenergic blockers suggest that the small rise of plasma insulin after the injection of amphetamine into rats did not cause the brain changes; these are probably a consequence of hyperthermia.	The findings with streptozotocin suggest that the hyperthermic effect of amphetamine is manifested only in states of normal insulin secretion.	In light microscope studies endocrine cell data were expressed as number of cells per unit area of mucosa using a quantitative method after argentaffin and Grimelius's argyrophilic techniques and an immunoperoxidase reaction with glucagon and somatostatin (SRIF) antisera.	When glucose concentration in the medium was decreased from 300 to 100 mg/ml insulin release fell to 2--5 microunit/culture/day.	Dependence of plasminogen activation on time of plasma incubation with kaolin and on temperature as well as the effect of proteinases inhibitors on the plasmin activity are studied.	To investigate the mechanism of the cellular insulin insensitivity of diabetic rats, insulin binding, glucose transport, and glucose oxidation were studied in adipocytes from streptozotocin-diabetic rats.	In conclusion, although the cellular insulin insensitivity exists in adipocytes from diabetic rats, the number of insulin receptors was increased, coupling between insulin receptors and the glucose transport system is intact in adipocytes from diabetic rats, and a defect in intracellular glucose metabolism rather than glucose transport plays a major role in the insulin insensitivity of adipocytes from diabetic rats.	It is proposed that nightly renal hemodynamic changes (during meal digestion or with high renin plasma levels) can induce modifications in glomerular filtration rate and electrolytes and macromolecules transglomerular flow.	Lowering the temperature from 37.5 degrees C to 28 degrees C does not alter the glucagon secretion by the isolated perfused rat pancreas in response to different glucose concentrations (0 g/l 1.5 g/l, 3 g/l and 5 g/l).	1) At a low concentration (0.05 mM) nicotine provokes an immediate, progressively increasing and lasting stimulation of insulin secretion.	2) At a high concentration (1 mM) nicotine has a triphasic effect on insulin secretion : brief decrease, peak of stimulation and prolonged decrease.	In the normal anesthetized dog, the endogenous hyperlactatemia induced either by intense muscular work or by a high dose of phenformin (20 mg/kg subtucaneously) is followed by an increase in the pancreaticoduodenal insulin output.	Proposed model offers three transfer functions answering to a second order hypothesis and allowing to study separately blood sugar evolution and insulin release or synthesis functions by cell B.	The amino-acid sequence of tyrosinase from Neurospora crassa (monophenol,dihydroxyphenylalanine:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.14.18.1) is reported.	Treatment of cells with lysophosphatidylcholine, lysozyme, and phospholipase D removed most of their phospholipids and reduced ATPase activity to near zero.	Lipid analyses of cell fractions were possible through separation of cell wall and cell membrane in a sucrose gradient after differentiated treatment of glutaraldehyde fixed cells with lysophosphatidylcholine, lysozyme, and pronase.	Membrane lipid peroxidation did not affect microsomal adenosine triphosphatase activity unless the microsomal fraction was subsequently washed with albumin.	Addition of soya-bean phospholipids to the peroxidized vesicles washed with albumin restored adenosine triphosphatase activity, demonstrating a non-specific phospholipid requirement.	Finally, the growth of transformed BHK cells in soft agar does not display a requirement for plasminogen and is not inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor.	Using the ultracytochemical pyroantimonate technique different patterns of calcium containing precipitates were found in the B cells of the isolated perfused rat pancreas under conditions of stimulated and inhibited insulin secretion.	Perfusion with 20 mM D-glucose over a period of 30 min resulted in calcium distribution patterns which could be related to the biphasic insulin release.	The data suggest that an increase in the membrane associated calcium may induce the first phase of insulin secretion by triggering the exocytosis of peripheral granules, while the cytoplasmic calcium may be involved in long term regulation of insulin release.	Mice have been immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide, cortisone-acetate, irradiation, or Ehrlich ascitic fluid (EAF) and then grafted with Ehrlich tumor or with one of the following strain-specific tumors: thymoma, methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma, B-16 melanoma, lymphatic leukaemia, and myeloid leukaemia.	Isolated, Langendorff-perfused hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer, glucose, insulin, and amino acids.
